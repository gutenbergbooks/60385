</div>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c008'>THOUGH the adventures recorded in this book may
set up the impression that I am a kind of Don
Quixote of the South Seas, I do not claim to have
sought to redress wrongs done to beauteous dusky
maidens. It was the ardent, adventurous spirit of youth
that brought me to the side of such original characters
as Fae Fae, Soogy, and Fanga, and gave me the charming
friendship of those pagan chiefs who have inspired
me to write this book. It is possible that many stay-at-homes
will think I have romanced, will think it incredible
that such characters as I have attempted to portray really
existed. Well, all I can say is, that my greatest literary
effort in the following pages has been to keep to the
truth of the whole matter, even though such frankness
should leave me, at the end of this volume, with a
blackened name.</p>

<p class='c009'>As I have introduced several Polynesian legends and
myths in this book, I would like to make a few remarks
with reference thereto. In recording my memories of
Island folk-lore I have to use, of course, my own
order of intelligence—as compared with that of the wild
people who told the stories—when I attempt to recreate
the legendary lore, the poetry, and the loveliness of the
natural world as it must have appeared to the imagination
of primitive minds believing in them. In doing
this I merely accept the inevitable transmutation which
all legends and myths of primitive peoples must undergo
when written down.</p>

<p class='c009'>Myths in their earliest stage were the poetic babblings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_VIII'>VIII</span>of the children of nature. It is certain that folk-lore
which comes to us in written form has been subjected
to obvious transformation. All creation-myths and
subtle moving legends that are representative of human
passions and yearning, be they from the lore of the
ancient Finns, Hindoos, Babylonians, Japanese, Egyptians,
or Greeks, have been completely transformed
before they reached us. Legends are told, retold, and
embellished in accordance with the storyteller’s notion
of what seems compatible with and faithful to primitive
conceptions, until, out of the imaginative fires of a
dozen or so narrators, we get the poetic picture which
the primitive mind probably conceived, but was unable
to express. There is little doubt, I imagine, that, if it
were possible to trace our great epic poems to their
remote original sources, we should find them based on
simple poetic superstition which had its origin in the
minds of the lowest tribes of primitive man. Thus,
through the influence of mind on mind, the world’s
great epic, when compared to that far-off original, will
resemble it as much as the nightingale’s egg of this
summer will resemble the full-fledged bird’s midnight-song
to next year’s moon.</p>

<p class='c009'>So much would I say for my method in writing my
reminiscences of heathen fairy-land. As for idol-worship,
I have written about it just as O’Hara and I
saw it with our own eyes, distinct and solid as are the
biblical images of stone in the churches of our own
sacred creed.</p>

<p class='c009'>I make no attempt to trace outside influences on the
mythologies of Island creeds; indeed, no influences can
be traced. The only influence I was aware of, or ever
heard discussed, was this, that with the advent of the
missionary, Island mythology and heathen legends were
sponged off the map of existence. The missionaries,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_IX'>IX</span>naturally enough, could see no use in preserving legendary
creeds founded on idol-worship and sacrificial
cannibalism, and all that was certainly “not the correct
thing” in a world where morals and manners differ so
greatly from our own. In this way, both the old legends
and the crude, primitive conceptions of religious worship
have long since been swept away, and sometimes
also the tribes that cherished these crude ideas were
swept away with their creeds.</p>

<p class='c009'>Islands that twenty years ago had populations numbering
many thousand, to-day have a scattered population
of a hundred or so. The blue-blooded Marquesan tribes
have been wiped out. The survivors are so mixed in
blood that they do not seem the children of their fathers.
So rapid has been the change that many old chiefs
are still living who recall the days when the voices of
the winds and mountains were mutterings of the mighty
gods of shadowland. Born under the influences of new
conditions, the natives of to-day do not look back beyond
the <i>lotu</i> times. Their imaginations are steeped in the
atmosphere of the biblical stories they learn in the
mission-room. Having a sense of shame for the sins
of their fathers, they deny even the far-off wonders of
the tapu-groves. In these tapu-groves, and beneath the
sacred banyan trees, there once stood the heathen temples
(<i>mareas</i>), the dwelling-places of those terrible priests
who, empowered by superstitious reverence, officiated at
the sacrificial altars. These priests were more powerful
in their profession than cannibal chiefs or heathen kings.
Looking at the ruins of the altars overgrown with weeds,
it seems incredible that human hands were once lifted
in supplication to relentless captors before they were
sacrificed to the bigotry of heathen gospel. It forces
upon us the similarity of their fate and that of our old
English martyrs. In the forest, hard by, slept the dead—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_X'>X</span>dead who were the strange, wild peoples that once
made every shadow a lurking god, their superstitious eyes
seeing the starlit forest’s height as some mighty dark-branched
brain of a heathen deity’s glittering thoughts.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Polynesians believed that their great ancestors
were metamorphosed into stars; in this belief there is
something of the Egyptian and Hellenic touch. There
are many star-legends concerning the origin of the
conspicuous constellations of their lovely skies, legends
that strangely resemble those of Greek mythology. As
Circé turned Odysseus’ comrades into swine, so did the
heathen goddesses turn Samoan warriors into crabs,
snakes, and cuttle-fish. Travellers have often been
struck by this resemblance in South-Sea mythology to
the folk-lore of the western world. The resemblance,
I think, is easy enough to understand, for Man is man
wherever one goes in this wide world. Be he black,
tawny, or white, his innermost hopes and aspirations
are much the same.</p>

<p class='c009'>The South-Sea savage gazed with the same wondering
eyes of hope on the travelling sun, moon, and stars.
To his childlike mind they were the movements of his
mighty deities and ancestors. He too peopled the
visible universe with gods and goddesses, as did the
ancient Greeks; the phenomena of nature impressed
his mind in much the same way as it has impressed mankind
from the remotest ages. The same kind of sorrow
dwelt in the hearts of those old-time savages when they
gazed on the dead child in the forest. The sunsets
blew the silent bugles of mysterious hues along their
horizons, touching their lovely skylines with unheard
but visible melodies over the briefness of all living
things. They too crept out of their forests long ages
ago, and stared with wonder on the rainbow that shone
over their empurpled seas. Those old rainbows, sunsets,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XI'>XI</span>and stars left the first etherealized impressions of
beauty in the heart of primeval Man the world over.
And those old rainbows, sunsets, and stars still exist,
are shining to-day in Man’s imagination, in all those
longings for the beautiful that we call “Strivings after
Art.” Thus there is a strong link, a twinship between us
and those past savage races. Their old symbols of the
stars, drifting clouds, fading sunsets, and moons that
once hung in the wide galleries of their heaven still
exist in all our poetic conceptions of that which is wild
and beautiful. Through the alchemy of man’s transmuting
mind, the wonders of that old world are
represented in all that is highest in our Art; the very
landscape-painting that hangs on our homestead walls
to-day faintly expresses the poetic light that once sparkled
in the eyes of those who lived when the world dreamed
in its savage childhood. The music <i>maestro</i> to-day
stands before the footlights, not of the stars, but before
Man’s artificial splendour of lamplit halls, a highly-cultured
savage, some wonderful embodiment of the
genius who once blew in the magical conch-shell—that
old barbarian musician who instinctively caught the
harmonies of creation from the resounding primeval seas,
the winds in the forests, and the songs of the first birds,
applying them as sympathetic symbols of sound that he
might please the earnest longings, the deepest dreams of
that shaggy-haired, fierce audience that assembled in their
barbarian forest halls. So it seems that nothing that
pleases our eyes and senses belong to civilization or is
of our own making. I imagine that it has all been
derived from the first tremendous blackboard—the primitive
days and starlit nights of heathen lands. And, so,
the first wild children of creation were our masters, who
unconsciously studied in the great school of Art under
God’s mysterious tuition that we might feel the pride
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XII'>XII</span>and glory of all that is beautiful and divine, with hope
in this far-away New Day! We dwell to-day in a
materialistic age of brassy-blare and “advanced thought.”
We have weighted ourselves with the thick armour of
civilization, till we fight on with curved spines, hardly
listing where we may fall. The old mythological light
of the stars is now switched on the pounding machinery
of our cities, instead of being fixed on our imaginations.
We grope in some darkness of our own making, as a
thousand sects mumble in their beards about some dubious
hope beyond the grave. We are chained prisoners
in the stone cells of our own vaunted ambitions. No
flower or singing bird is a true symbol of hope, delight,
or wonder; all that we see is divested of the fairy-wings
of that imagination that brings us wealth beyond our
fleshly selves. The true poetry of life has gone for ever.
The wild bird’s song steams in our old stew-pot—we
like it better that way! But one must suppose that
all this is as it should be. Nevertheless, we are the old
savages, the Dark Ages, in a double sense, dreaming
that we are the children of the Golden Age! The nursery
tale told to the children as they sat by some Kentish
homestead’s fireside last night, was whispered into the
ears of wondering children of the South Seas long ages
ago.</p>

<p class='c009'>In reference to the general style of my book, I have
written on the theory that autobiographical writing
should be inspired, not by any idea of the apparent
merits of those things which the author may feel that
he has done well, but from his indwelling regret over
the many things which he has never succeeded in doing
at all. I imagine that it is so easy to convince the
world of our faults and so difficult to interest it by
putting down on paper those virtues we all secretly
hope we possess. However that may be, my reader
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XIII'>XIII</span>can rest assured that my memoirs are based on my
happy meditations over all the great, worldly things
that I have never succeeded in doing, and so, whatever
interest my book lacks, is not lacking through any fault
of my own.</p>

<p class='c009'>I feel that it is necessary to admit here that I have
been obliged to dig deep whilst resuscitating from the
legendary dark the old mummies, the gods and goddesses
which I found buried in the pyramids of heathen
mythology. It is I who have breathed the new breath of
life into their dusty nostrils as I unrolled their spiced,
rotting swathings so that they might have some resemblance
to the time when they had true visionary existence
before the wondering eyes of those wild, savage
peoples of a mythological past. I have placed them, with
a little diffidence, on their crumbling feet, refashioning
them with their unsewn eyelids and mouths somewhat
awry, on show in the temple of my memoirs, in full
view, standing along the aisles of dim remembrance,
faintly lit up, I hope, by the light of my own imagination.</p>

<p class='c009'>As books of an autobiographical nature usually devote
a chapter or so to incidents connected with the
author’s birth and childhood, and as some of the critics
of my previous books wished to know something of
my genesis, I am pleased to say that I am still full
of go, still following the sea-birds and land-birds on my
vagabond travels. Through my parentage I can claim
the blood of three nations—English, Scottish, and a
strain of Italian—my mother being a descendant of
Thomas Haynes Bayly, the English ballad-writer;
my father, a literary man, a descendant of Charles,
the second Earl of Middleton, and a lady of the Italian
Court: I believe this lady wrote some revolutionary
songs, which were the direct cause of her enforced
flight from her own country. Having said this much,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_XIV'>XIV</span>I will retire as gracefully as possible by saying that I
have only stepped on the stage of this book as one of
its humblest actors, as a hollow-voiced prompter who
would bolster up the reputations of his old friends of
the past with the weight of his fleshly self. And so
I am here in the spirit of good comradeship, the far-away
echo of my violin on the South-Sea buskin march assisting
those who are scattered or dead, and no longer
able to help themselves on this new stage of a shadowy
drama in which I have placed them.</p>

      <div class='line'>That Eldorado where men yawned and seemed to make their piles!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c018'>EVEN the wind, my boon companion—for are we
not both born roamers?—seems to blow chunks of
old memories through the moonlit, tossing pines that are
sighing to-night outside this wayside inn. It’s here that
we rest awhile, my fiddle and I, as I take up my pen to
record some of the incidents from my early travels.
Time, in its everlasting hurry, gives me the briefest
space to say all I wish to say; and ere the month ends
I shall be, once more, outbound on the western ocean.</p>
<p class='c009'>Personally, I think that to have inherited a pair of
rose-coloured spectacles from one’s ancestors is to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>been endowed at birth with inexhaustible wealth, as well
as being born a king in one’s own right. Such an inheritance
enables one to conjure up the finest illusions,
helps one to surmount apparently impossible heights,
and also cheers one in each inevitable precipitous fall.
I’ve often blessed the fates in the thought that they so
kindly enabled me to warm my hands and heart by
an imaginary fire when the winds were blowing cold. So
much would I say, in complete humbleness, about my
special gift. Possibly the aforesaid gift is the only inherited
privilege that entitles me to write this book dealing
with my life and travels in the South Seas. So far
as the world’s and my own opinion goes, I’ve no violent
claim to write more than three books. For, true enough,
it does not make for notoriety and a keen interest in one’s
self from a wide public to have done the things that I’ve
done. I seriously doubt if my effigy will be seen in
Madame Tussaud’s waxwork show when I come to die.
The plain fact is, that it is not considered highly respectable
to have slept in a wharf-dustbin in a strange
land, unashamed, and with the lid on! And to have
knelt in the complete obeisance of idolatry before a
wooden idol with a tattooed heathen poet, and deliberately
worshipped at the old shrine of the stars, is, to
say the least, <i>not quite the thing</i>. Neither does a wandering
vagabond life, and a deep feeling of kinship with
strange old shellbacks, ragged derelicts, and tattooed
chiefs, lay a suitable foundation for recording one’s
omissions and sins in polite form. However that may be,
I believe that to have dined deeply on salt-horse and
weevily hard-tack, and to have played the fiddle on the
“Wallaby track” from Maoriland to the Solomon Isles,
is to have gathered an outfit of dire accomplishments that
I hope may have inspired me with something to say.</p>

<p class='c009'>First of all, I will say that, though I had been smashing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>about the seaports from Shanghai to Callao, and
had trekked across the Never-Never land, generally
bound for Nowhere, I still had strange hopes that wild
pioneer life and romance, as I had read about it ere
I ran away to sea, existed somewhere in the world. I
was down in the dumps, stranded in Sydney, when the
great opportunity presented itself. By the wharf, in the
harbour, lay a three-masted ship. When I went aboard
I heard that she was bound for the South Sea Islands—the
Isles of the Blest!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Any chance of a job?” I said to the chief mate.
He solemnly shook his head, then critically scanned
me, then pointing towards the cuddy aft, referred me
to the skipper. Entering the gloom of the cuddy’s
small alley-way, I bumped up against the “Old Man.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What yer wan?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Any chance of a job, sir?” I murmured in my very
best longing-for-work voice. The skipper stood stroking
his whiskers, and, after scrutinizing me from head to
feet, demanded to see my discharges.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Git yer traps and come aboard.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I was engaged as a member of the crew.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next day we were towed down the harbour by a
tug, and by midnight had a steady wind on the quarter,
which took us out with all sails set into the Pacific.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a monotonous, long voyage. The “Saga,” for
that was the name of the ship, wasn’t a “Cutty Sark”
or a “Thermopylae” for speed.<a id='r1' /><a href='#f1' class='c019'><sup>[1]</sup></a> Anyway, the length
of the voyage helped to warm my ardent longing to
arrive at the palmy coral isles.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f1'>
<p class='c021'><span class='label'><a href='#r1'>1</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The “Cutty Sark” and “Thermopylae” were two of the fastest
sailing ships running from London to Sydney. The author sailed
before the mast from Sydney to San Francisco on the “Cutty Sark.”</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>I think I was the happiest member of the crew when,
after much buffeting with wild weather and stinking
pork and maggoty hard-tack, our old wind-jammer
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>hugged the outer reefs of the Samoan Isles. Ah, the
music of the long-drawn sounds of the surges beating
over the barrier reefs! I half fancied I could hear the
palms sighing lyrical melodies as the winds crept like
overflowing zephyrs from some great scented dream
across that pagan world. On the dim blue horizon
rose ranges of mountains, apparently touching the tropic
sky: they were, to me, the peaks of romance!</p>

<p class='c009'>The dry tongues of the aged, seasoned sailors hung
out as they rubbed their tarry hands and sniffed the
distant grog-saloon. Old M’Dougal, the ship’s carpenter,
danced a jig and looked human for the first time. The
Dutch boatswain pulled his red beard, gave a terrific
grin in the moonlight, and muttered something about
“Voomen and vine.” Then I got my few belongings
together, packed my violin carefully, and was ready
to go ashore.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was quite dark when I found myself being rowed,
or rather paddled, ashore in an outrigger canoe. As
I went gliding by the moon-ridden lagoons, I felt that
at last I had surely entered some magical harbour of
a fairy-land.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even when sunrise came like a silent crash of liquid
gold over the wide Pacific, touching the mountain peaks
and the scattered bee-hive-shaped huts of the forest
townships, I was not disillusioned. All seemed as I
had so fondly anticipated; it was as I had read about
it all. Men yarned and argued dogmatically as they
stood, fierce-eyed, before the bar of the wooden grog-shanty;
there they stood, attired in large slouched hats,
telling such mighty things about their thrilling travels
that even old Homer, could he have heard, might well
have sighed with envy!</p>

<p class='c009'>When dusk came and I heard the tribal drums beating
the stars in far away up in the forest villages, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>thought, “Here at least I shall find rest from the hot-footed
turbulency of civilized humanity; here I can dwell
beneath the Eden-like shades of feathery palms, and
listen to the wind-blown melodies as they come in from
the sea and run across the island trees.” I revelled in
such like thoughts. I felt that I had come across a
pagan world where no more should I hear servile mumblings
of a conventional people. I would peer into
savage bright eyes and listen to the poetic lore of people
who worshipped at the shrine of the stars and
counted their days by the fading moons. But when
the fierce-eyed, tattooed chief, leaning on his war-club
before the rough customers of the grog-shanty’s bar,
looked straight into the eyes of an old shellback, and,
bringing his club down with a crash, said, with much
vehemence, that he preferred Solomon’s Songs to the
second chapter of the Corinthians, I rubbed my eyes
and thought I dreamed! My chagrin was immense;
those delectable palm-clad isles of primitive lore and
romance had come under the blighting influence of civilization
and of missionaries!</p>

<p class='c009'>I was in Apia, Samoa, R. L. S., attired in his velvet
coat, walked into the bar-room and then suddenly said,
“Damn!” when the Beachcomber trod on his toe, bowed,
and said, “Beg pawden, soir!” I strolled afar and discovered
that bright-eyed babies, nestling at the bosoms
of their shaggy-haired, handsome mothers, slept as “safe
as houses” in doorless, small-thatched dens under the
moonlit palms. And, wandering on, I saw star-eyed,
nymph-like girls with tossing, coral-dyed hair, pass and
repass me on the lonely forest track, singing merrily in
a musical tongue as they dived once more into the shadows
of the coco-palms.<a id='r2' /><a href='#f2' class='c019'><sup>[2]</sup></a> All this was extremely pleasing.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>But one may imagine how my tenacious illusions
were grossly shattered when the majestic ex-king Malaetoa

said, “Mine’s a bitter!”</p>

<p class='c009'>O, illusive Romance!</p>

<p class='c009'>Nevertheless adventure abounded. Those semi-savage
men sang weird soulful songs, melodious ballads, about
half-forgotten legends, and battles long ago; and their
love-songs were as pleasing as the beauty and innocence
of their womenkind. I roamed those palm-clad shores
for days, and was considerably enlightened in an educational
way, for I came across clans of strange old
heathens, who seemed to me to be the disciples of the
one true transcendent democracy. They were semi-naked
heathen philosophers, old men clad in loin-cloths
only. My pleasure was immense when I observed them
sitting by their coral cave doors, solemnly chewing nuts,
apparently as happy as the sunny, livelong day. It was
sunset, and when they all commenced to beat their drums
violently, beating the stars in, it seemed that their hoarse,
quaintly musical voices, wailed out, “Behold! we are
the people! Creation hath nobly toiled through the ages
till, lo! the blessed sun warms our aged bones as nature
casts into our trembling hands digestible nuts and sweet-scented
taro!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Could I help liking the companionship of such happy,
wise old philosophers?</p>

<p class='c009'>Many of those old-time natives were endowed with
wonderful poetic intellect. And I vow that such an
intellect my old Samoan friend, O Le Tao, possessed.
I came across Tao about three weeks after arriving in
Upolu. And I may say, that though I’ve played the
fiddle under a palm tree outside a barbarian queen’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>royal seraglio, and have been given the <i>Freedom of the
pagan city</i> in consequence, I can recall no one who was
more hospitable to me than O Le Tao. And so, before
proceeding with the wild life and adventures which I
experienced after leaving Samoa for Tahiti, I would
like just to touch on O Le Tao’s character and genius
by the way. In fact, O Le Tao was interesting, if only
on account of his physiognomy, which strangely resembled
the weird scenery of Samoa by moonlight—scenery
that I feel is an eminently suitable background for introducing
him, and not in an impressionistic sketch either,
but just as I knew him in his meditative old age.</p>

<p class='c009'>First, I would tell you that it was a lovely sight to
see the tropical orange flush of evening fade to a deep,
fairy-like green on the sea’s horizon beyond the scimitar-shaped
bay off Apia. Then, one by one, the stars
peeped out, not down from the sky, but wistful-like up
from the lagoons along the shore. It was an Olympian
scene and one that I should imagine would inspire the
most unimaginative observer. The native villages were
silent; the mountains, like mighty sentinels staring out
to sea, stood with tangled forest beards, sighing down
to their rugged knees. Moonlit lines of palms waved like
majestic plumes against the crystalline skies; a falling
star seemed a pale ember blown out of the far-off constellations.
But for the tiny pagan city of huts, nestling
as it were in the crevice of the mountain’s hip, it might
have been an uninhabited island world. Far down in
the lower regions, in the vicinity of the mountain’s vast
feet, a canoe was paddled out from the hairy growths
between those mighty toes. It was a savage, wrinkled
old man of another age, paddling off for the silent waters
in a canoe, that was, to him, a small argosy bearing
him away to the wonders of shadowland! But it wasn’t
as weird as all that; it was simply the Samoan chief,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>O Le Tao, stealing away under the cover of night to
one of the neighbouring islets, so that he might worship
his hidden idol. Though I cannot claim to have
been there on that special night, I well know it was none
other than O Le Tao. And how I know this is my own
secret. Possibly I’ve been a heathen too, and have prostrated
myself before an idol; I’m queer enough for
anything. However that may be, I recall that I met
O Le Tao next day. I was travelling along in the
vicinity of Mount Vala. I had just had an appetizing
meal of Bass’s Ale and monkey-nuts—and was feeling
in good humour. Coco-palms, breadfruits, and other
picturesque trees sheltered me from the hot sunlight and
my banana-leaf socks hardly swished as I softly trod
the beautifully woven carpet of flower and fern that
Nature’s patient hand had spread across the forest floor.
The sea breeze swept pungent whiffs, like iced wine,
to my nostrils, as I followed the track made by soft-footed
savages for ages. Suddenly I was startled by
seeing a frizzly, partially bald head protrude through
the bamboos. It was O Le Tao’s cranium.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What you wanter here?” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Talofa! e maloto ea oe” (I greet you, comrade,
and hope you are well), I responded, as the chief’s brow
puckered up with suspicion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What you gotter there—moosic?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” I responded, as he eyed my violin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You no tafoa vale?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No; I’m a friend,” I replied, as I handed him a
mark. This largesse changed his aggressive look into
a broad smile of welcome. Following him, I entered
his hut. I sat on his best mat and drank refreshing coco-nut
milk. Suddenly we were disturbed by hearing loud
grunts, heavy breathing, and smashing of twigs. In another
moment an aged Samoan woman entered the hut.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>She was a fine-looking old woman, and had kind eyes.
She was carrying a huge calabash of water beneath one
arm. Its cumbersome weight did not deter her from
further efforts—in the other hand she held a coco-nut,
a basketful of fish—all alive O!—on her back a bunch
of bananas, and between her teeth two fishing rods.
She was O Le Tao’s industrious better half. She too
made me welcome. Then pretty Cenerita, their daughter,
arrived. She had pretty hair, and eyes that outshone
the gleams of the three coco-nut-oil lamps, hanging
from the hut’s low roof that night; for it all ended
in O Le Tao asking me to stay the night with them.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the hour was late, I felt very contented as I
squatted by their homestead’s door by Cenerita’s side.
Then the old chief commenced to tell me about the grand
old freebooting times.</p>

<p class='c009'>O Le Tao was over seventy years of age, and so was
a reliable authority on the old sins and wonders of the
heathen period of his palmy isles.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the old chief spoke on, and his wife, Cenerita, and
I sat by the doorway that faced the ocean, I too became
transformed into a semi-heathen, the Samoan underworld
becoming some dim, far-off reality to my brain.
The moon shone over the dark waters, and the voices
coming from the dark shore caves just below seemed to
drum out muffled echoes from the old gods of shadowland,
as I listened to all that O Le Tao told.</p>

<p class='c009'>Cenerita had ceased to sing. We could faintly hear
the <i>o le sanga</i> (red-winged nightingale) whistling its
melodious song somewhere up in the mountain breadfruits.
And still O Le Tao spoke on in this wise:</p>

<p class='c009'>“O Papalagi, you must know and believe that, in
those far-off days, the great spirits of shadowland did
walk about the native villages by night. Often would
the gods knock at the doors of the great <i>Atuiis</i> (high
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>chiefs), bidding them strive for their mighty requirements;
which were many. And sad enough for us in
the great sacrificial month!” said O Le Tao after a
pause; then he continued: “O white man, I must tell
you that Lao-mio was my kinsman’s child and was a
maid beautiful to gaze upon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Doubtless,” I said, as he continued.</p>

<p class='c009'>“And of course she was daughter of great chief,
so to fall in love with a low-caste youth, as she did,
was a terrible disgrace to me and my people. Also the
gods, Tangaloa, Tuli, Tane, and the goddesses of O E
Langi (Elysium) were dark-browed with anger about it
all. ’Tis true that the low-caste youth was handsome
to look upon, straight as a coco-palm, with eyes like a
katafa bird’s. But such things do not make up for
the lack of great blood and the pride of the gods in one’s
heart.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, certainly not,” said I, as O Le Tao’s wrinkled
physiognomy revealed the pride he felt over those old
ancestors that he claimed. Then he continued:</p>

<p class='c009'>“One night, when we were all fast asleep in our
village by Tewaka, we did all leap suddenly up from
our sleeping mats, for lo! the conch-shells of the gods
in shadowland were blowing! True enough the gods
and goddesses were rushing about the forests in great
anger! We did know that something terrible had occurred,
for their voices sounded like to thunder and
echoed to the mountain tops. As all my people did
rush from their huts, the gods disappeared in the moonlight,
but we were all just in time to see a canoe being
fast paddled across the bay out to sea! Ah, Papalagi,
’twas great insult; for it was that low-caste youth Ko-Ko,
for that was his name, and Lao-mio, the high-caste
maid, in flight together. For a moment we gazed
dumb-struck, the horror of the scene before us being
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>on the faces of all the chiefs. And the <i>O tausalas</i> (high-class
girls and women) weep to see so wicked a sight.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Saying the foregoing, O Le Tao placed his wrinkled
hand to his brow and gazed in deep reflection on the
scene that was apparently before his memory. Then,
as his old wife handed him a goblet of kava (he swallowed
it at a gulp), he cast his eyes skyward and continued:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Suddenly we all recover our senses, and go rushing
down to the shore. But it was too late. The cunning
Ko-Ko had severed the sennet tackles and had cast
all our canoes adrift, so that we could not follow him.
He was very low-caste too, for, as the canoe turned
round by the promontory, he did turn his face to us
and waved his paddle jeeringly! And though my kinsmen
and many of the tausalas did dance with much
rage on the shore at this act of Ko-Ko’s, I did myself
keep calm, as great chief should keep; crossing my arms
on my breast, I did spit seaward. It was then that we
all turned, and rushing way back to the village we looked
into the hut wherein Lao-mio had slept. Lo, master, we
found <i>all</i> her clothes—she had left them behind! ’Twas
sad enough, this act of an erstwhile modest tausala maid,
but we did all beat our chests when we find the maid
had left a note behind her too, and this note said: ‘O
stink chiefs of Samoa, I go away with my true love
Ko-Ko, for his eyes are like unto the gods! And I
would have you know, O meddling people of the village,
that my children shall bless me for having so god-like
a husband!’</p>

<p class='c009'>“At reading this insult about the godliness of a low-caste,
we did all beat our limbs and bodies till the blood
fell. And as we did this act we heard the mighty, far-off
voices of the gods cursing our village, to think
that a high-caste tausala should elope with a cheeky
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>low-caste like Ko-Ko. The next day the great <i>toas</i>
(high chiefs) went away in sorrow to the sacred altars
at Manono, and, paying obeisance to the <i>autiis</i> (priests),
asked them to find out what the gods would have them
do about the whole matter. After many libations of
ceremonial kava and sacred offerings to the God of
gods, the vassals of shadowland did say: ‘You disgraced
people of Manono must away go into the forest by Lauii;
and when you are there you must play sweetest music
on the vuvu and the magic conch-shells while the moon
shines over the sea. It is then that the spirits will hear,
and will tell you what is best to be done to enable you
to catch the wicked lovers.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>Saying this, O Le Tao paused a moment, then, swelling
his tattooed chest to its full proportions, and with
his arms crossed high thereon, he gazed majestic-wise
upon Cenerita, his wife, and my humble self. Then,
turning his head and face round in the direction of the
mountains, he gazed in such a manner that it was plainly
evident he was about to divulge something reflecting
no small amount of glory upon his person. He continued:</p>

<p class='c009'>“When the village did hear that which the gods
wished to be done, they all meet by the sacred banyans,
and say, ‘Who? Who in our village am <i>great</i> enough
to respond to the wishes of the gods?’ And, Papalagi,
I would have you know that, whilst this talk go on,
I sit in full humbleness behind the assembled tribe in
deep shadow of breadfruit trees.” (I nodded my head,
intimating that I quite understood O Le Tao’s humility.)
Then he coughed, and proceeded: “For awhile I keep
my face bowed towards the earth; but still they call
in one great voice again, and yet again! And so, knowing
well that one cannot cast the power, the glory, and
majesty from one’s own person, I slowly did arise, and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>standing forth into the clear light of the moon’s fullness,
I say, ‘Who is this that calls aloud for O Le
Tao?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“And, in this wise, was I chosen above all others,
O Papalagi!</p>

<p class='c009'>“That same night I and Lao-mio’s father, who was
a kinsman of mine, did go away to seek the magic caves
where dwelt the vassals of the gods of the underworld.
When we arrived by the seashore we perceive four
young coco-palms growing, that had not been there before.
And, as we blew the conch-shells, the four coco-palms
did commence to quiver in the light of the moon,
the plumes and bunches of nuts that sprouted at the
tops starting to swell visibly. Still we did blow and
blow the vuvu and conch-shell; and still the coco-nuts
swell and swell till they gleam in the moonlight, and
lo! they were the big faces of the gods! We did then
notice that the trunks of the palms were their legs. My
kinsman and I did lean one against the other, so great
was our surprise to hear their voices. For, lifting their
shivering arms to the sky, they say, ‘O great O Le Tao,
and he too who am shadowed in your presence.’”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose the gods alluded to your kinsman?” said
I, interrupting the old chief.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That am so, Papalagi,” said Tao, as I struck a match
on my knee and intimated by a nod of my head that
I wished him to proceed. Then he continued in this
wise: “The gods looked down upon us and said, ‘If
you would once more get Lao-mio the maid back to
your village, you must go along the coast and approach
the caves wherein dwells the beautiful goddess Pafuto.
She will stand in your presence, and then lead you
across the sea to Savaii Isle so that you may get at the
maid Lao-mio.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“At saying these things they did look upon myself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>and my kinsman with deep concern shining like a shadow
on moonlit waters in their eyes, and then, again said:
‘You are mortals, and so we would tell you that, whatever
you do, you must not gaze upon the goddess Pafuto’s
face or form with amorous eyes, neither may you
let your hearts hold such thoughts as one may have when
gazing upon a beauteous mortal maid.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Papalagi, this wish of the gods did not trouble
us; but pulling my tappa robe around me I did at once
commence to go with my kinsman to the spot where
we might see the great goddess. When we did at length
come to the sea, the moonlight lay fast asleep on the
deep waters. The <i>o le manu ao</i> (Samoan nightingale),
hearing our approach, started singing its midnight song
to its favourite goddess <i>Langi</i> (heaven). We listened
until our hearts were charmed very much, so much so
that we both felt that our hearts were fit to urge our
voices to speak out those things which the gods had
told. And so I stepped forward, and say, ‘O le sanga
oa e magi langi.’ At hearing me speak, the <i>o le manu</i>
at once cease its song. Silence did fall and run on
silvery moonlight feet across the forest. Then, lo, a
shadow fell slantwise across the lagoon that faced the
sleeping ocean. We turn our eyes, and there, stepping
forth from her big shore cave, was the goddess Pafuto!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, Papalagi, never before did my eyes behold so
beautiful a goddess. Her raiment was made from the
finest wove seaweed. Her hair tresses, falling like a
golden river on the sunset mountains, made a wonderful
mat for her nicest of feet.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At this moment the old chief’s story was interrupted
by the arrival of Cenerita’s fiancé, a handsome youth
named Tamariki. As the youth sat at Cenerita’s feet,
O Le Tao gave him a freezing look that he should intrude
at such a moment. Then the old man placed his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>hand archwise over his eyes in some memory of the
dazzling beauty of the goddess Pafuto, and continued:
“The goddess gaze on us with magical light stealing
through her eyes, then she plucked a reed from the
lagoon’s edge and blew out a note of sweetest music.
At once the <i>o le manu ao</i> commenced to sing again, and
out of the cavern to the right of us came floating a <i>taumualua</i>
(native boat). My kinsman and I at once did
that which the goddess commanded, for we at once
jump into the taumualua. As we sat in the magic
canoe, she did softly step into it and give a magic sign.
It was with much sorrow that I did notice that the
taumualua carry no paddles, for, Papalagi, I feel that
the goddess may be for voyaging <i>beneath</i> the sea instead
of moving over the waters. But just as I did
look into my kinsman’s eyes in sorrow, the goddess did
stand upright between us. She was as tall as a mast
and as straight. Uplifting her robes and stretching her
curved arms out like unto sails of a ship, the night wind
did at once commence to softly blow. It was a wonderful
sight to see her robes gently fill out like big sails
to the blowing airs as the magical canoe start to move
silently across the moonlit waters.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As we did glide over the sea we could distinctly
see her shadow reflected in the water beside us, beside
the imaged moon that was full of brightness. Ah, Papalagi,
it was this uprightness of the goddess that did
bring about the fall of my kinsman. Alas, as she became
like to sails of a taumualua, because of the uplifting
of her robes there beside us, her graceful limbs
were revealed to half a finger’s length above the knees.
Truly, Papalagi, it was a sight to tempt even the gods,
let alone us poor mortals as we sat there, one each side
of that wondrous figure, my cheek almost touching the
right flank, and my kinsman’s the left knee.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>“Knowing deep in our hearts what the gods had
warned us about, we tried, more than I may tell, not
to behold or dream of her gracefulness and the secret
glory of such womanly loveliness, as we could have
done had she been a mortal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So, Papalagi, I did perspire overmuch through trying
to kill those thoughts that <i>will</i> afflict us poor mortals.
I sighed and prayed, and even sang a short <i>lotu-song</i>
(hymn) to help stifle those thoughts that dare not
rise from my heart. It was during this misery of mine
in endeavouring to keep faith with the gods and our
promises that I did notice my kinsman breathing heavily.
I look long upon him, and then see that he was
near to being <i>fauti</i> (in a fit) for trying also to stay his
deeper thoughts. Much fright came to my soul at seeing
the state of one whom I loved much and who was
near to me in blood. I did look eagerly across the
sea, and with much sorrow notice that we were still
more than a mile from the lonely shores of Savaii Isle.
The promontory was just visible far away to the north.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘What shall we do? What shall we do?’ I mutter
as I did see my kinsman’s form writhe in the agony
of his desires.</p>

<p class='c009'>“At this moment the goddess slightly swerved her
outstretched arms around to the north-east so that she
might catch the fairer wind. In this sudden action of
hers, her mass of beautiful hair fell about our shoulders,
for she had slowly moved her head likewise, so
that her face should be turned to the south-west; so
that, while her left arm point north-east, her face turn
south-west. Whether it was this movement of the changing
winds that made her tresses fall and prove my kinsman’s
undoing, I know not. But it is certain that, as
her masses of hair fell tenderwise on his face and shoulders,
her eyes, inclined sideways, gazed on him and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>on me in such a way as surely goddess never gazed to
tempt mortals before. And then, alas, whether the knees
moved through the soft swaying of the canoe or through
the sudden veering of the night wind, I know not, but
my kinsman’s lips did suddenly touch the left knee of
the goddess!</p>

<p class='c009'>“In a moment, as though lightning swept across the
moonlit waters, a flash of light leapt from the goddess’s
eyes—the canoe wherein we sat vanished—was as nothing!</p>

<p class='c009'>“For longer time I did swim and swim. And when
at length I sat on the shore, only the great goddess
Pafuto sat beside me! It was then I knew that my
sad kinsman had been unable to control his mortal
thoughts, and so was lying somewhere dead at the bottom
of the <i>moana uli</i> (the blue sea). Gazing upon me,
the goddess said, ‘O Le Tao, thou art a great chief.
Thou hast seen mucher beauty of the goddesses of Langi
in their true nakedness, and thou hast proven that thou
lovest the light of heaven in their eyes only.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“At hearing this, I felt much pride. Yet, true enough,
my heart did quake overmuch, for well I knew how near
I was to falling as my kinsman fell.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The old Samoan chief ceased for a moment. The
night winds blew softly, drifting the scents of ripe
lemons and breaths of decaying flowers to our nostrils.
Cenerita, under the influence of her parent’s story,
peered into the forest glooms. The grand chiefess,
Madame O Le Tao, puffed her cigarette and revealed
by the erect pose of her scraggy neck that she realized
the import of her position as O Le Tao’s faithful spouse.
The old chief, continuing his story, said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“O Papalagi, when the goddess Pafuto said that to
me which I have just told you, I feel much proud and
thankful for her mercy. I well knew that she know
<span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>in her heart that I too had been near to breaking my
promise when the taumualua swayed. But, still, she
know what great soul O Le Tao am!—so she say no
more. Indeed, it was at this moment that she did bend
forward, softly touching me on the shoulder with her
lips, and so did make me <i>taboo</i> (a sacred personage).
When I did get back to the village and told the chiefs
all that had happened, they, though much grieved to
hear of my kinsman’s death, thought little more of the
flight of the lovers, Lao-mio and K-ko-ko. They did
at once prepare great festival to celebrate the glory that
the goddess Pafuto had sent back such a great one as
I to still dwell amongst them.”</p>

<p class='c009'>When he had made an end, the old chief lifted his
shoulders majestically, surveying me keenly the while
with his dim eyes. It was then that I realized how
those island chiefs and the ancestors of knights and
kings of all lands had first gained their power, their
possessions, and mighty insignia. I instinctively knew
that not only in those wild isles were men gifted with
an imagination that made them have firm belief in all
that they dreamed of over their own greatness. I half
envied O Le Tao’s gifts—gifts he had so well utilized.
For as he sat there I saw that he was enthroned on
the heights of magnificent imagination and lived in the
light of respect from all men’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such was O Le Tao’s story of the goddess Pafuto,
as told me while the Samoan night doves moaned musically
in the tamanu trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>During my stay the semi-heathen chief took me to
many interesting places, showing me spots in the forests
and along the shores where once some great tribal
battle had been fought, or some cave wherein, on certain
occasions, gods and goddesses met in midnight council.
After that, O Le Tao took Cenerita, Tamariki, and myself
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>to a night dance in the shore village near Monono. I
am assured that Man cannot improve on Nature’s handiwork
in building roomy halls for secret congregations
of human beings who would indulge in heathenish capers
that endeavour to express the inherent impulses of mankind.
The gnarled pillars and flower-bespangled curtains
of that wonderful forest opera-house, decorated
by Nature’s artless, silent-moving hands, left nothing
to be desired even by the most critical <i>Maestro</i> who
might happen to perform on the wide, branch-roofed
stage. The moon hanging in the vaulted roof of space
over the trees, was sufficient for all purposes. The acoustic
properties were perfect, the neighbouring hills echoing
back each orchestral crescendo and each encore in
obsequious, weird diminuendos. In the intervals of silence
it would often seem that I heard some phantom-like
accompaniment, and faint encores coming from the gods
of shadowland, ere the barbaric orchestra of fifes, bone
flutes, and drums once more recommenced its terrific
ensemble. I was more than astonished to see O Le
Tao suddenly throw his stiff legs out as he commenced
to dance with an elderly chiefess of enormous girth.
A hundred dusky Eyes seemed to tempt a hundred willing
Adams as the sarong-like robes swished to tripping
feet when the whole audience began to dance before
the footlights of the stars! With the characteristic restraint
of my race, I clenched my fist in a great mental,
virtuous effort, but only to fail through my miserable
fallibility, for, opening my closed eyelids, I stared with
unblushing effrontery at the <i>prima donna’s</i> exquisitely
woven concert-robe—the equivalent of the South Sea
fig-leaf!</p>

<p class='c009'>She still danced on, a fascinating being, with the
golden light of some witchery in her eyes. Her clustered
tresses were distinctly visible by the pale glimmerings
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>of the moon that silvered the huge colonnades of the
stage. And, all the while she danced, she sang an ear-haunting
melody, swaying her limbs, a scarlet blossom
nestling in the hollow of her bosom. “Aue! Aue!
Talofa!” came from the lips of the tiers of gay warriors
and great high chiefs who squatted in the royal
boxes. When the handsome young chief, Tusita Le Salu—the
head-dancer’s affianced—stepped down from his
perch in the breadfruit tree on the stage, the hubbub
was immense. He at once faced the dancer in a god-like
style, and commenced to sing a duet with her. They
danced and tumbled about in a marvellous way. And
when she lifted the pretty blue sarong robe up to her
knees, I distinctly heard the aged O Le Tao groan
through some pathetic realization over his departed
youth. Yet the most fastidious could have gazed with
delight on that scene: the whole thing was fairy-like,
the girl’s dancing creating an atmosphere that was full
of poetic mystery and nothing more.</p>

<p class='c009'>The festival’s orchestra helped in no small way to
enhance the poetic beauty of the whole scene. The bamboo
flutes and bone-clappers (made from the skeletons
of dead chiefs) played a suitable accompaniment to the
many “turns” that I witnessed. The special music
that was performed on this occasion was something
between a Marquesan <i>Tapriata</i> and a Samoan <i>Siva dance</i>.
Though I cannot reproduce the moaning of the resounding
seas on the shore below or the echoes in the
mountains, I give here an impressionist piano-forte arrangement
of the wild music I heard that night.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is many years since O Le Tao departed for the
legendary splendours of his beloved shadowland: that
much I certainly know. For, on a voyage bound for
the Malay Archipelago, not so long ago, my ship put
into Samoa, and, standing in the small village cemetery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>near Safuta, I gazed in sorrow on a little wooden cross,
and distinctly made out these words, written in English
and Samoan:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c022'>
    <div>“Here lieth the mortal remains of High Chief</div>
    <div>O LE TAO</div>
    <div>Died, aged 83, in the year of our Lord, 1903.”</div>
    <div>“In my Father’s House are Many Mansions.”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Gazing on that grave, I realized the briefness of all
living things, be they great or small. There was something
pathetic too in so humble a tomb for one who
had dwelt in such imaginative splendour. For the island
nightingale still sang its passionate song in the
breadfruit, as the same aged tamanu trees sighed in
their glory by the sea. But, doubtless, the children of
a new age still whisper his name in wonder, telling
how he was favoured by the goddess Pafuto for the
majesty and inborn virtue of his mighty heart.</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c009'>When I left O Le Tao’s hospitable homestead it was
with feelings of regret, and it was a long time before
I returned to Samoa. Brief as was my stay with that
old chief, it was of long enough duration to influence
me; indeed, I might say that I became a semi-pagan
too. Cenerita no longer pointed in vain to the moonlit
mountains, attempting to show my blind eyes the
shadow-gods that she declared were stalking across the
moon-ridden hills—I too saw them! I became a veritable
heathen. My personality became robed in the weird
atmosphere of pagan dreams. Civilization fell from me
like an immaculate tall hat knocked off one’s head with
a brick. The stern, dull, drab colour of the world
changed for me. The bright-winged <i>katafa</i>, the brown-robed
<i>O Le mao</i> bird, and bronzed-winged Samoan doves
became warm-throated goddesses sitting in the breadfruit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>trees over our heads, their eyes bright with discovery
as I played heathenish melodies and Cenerita sang.
I was happy enough, for I lived in a small native house
all alone; it had two rooms and was allotted me by the
kindness of O Le Tao. That hut was my tiny grand
ancestral hall. Just beyond my threshold waved the
plumes of my coat-of-arms—a coco-nut tree crowned
with a tawny bunch of fruit. My clock, far away over
the wide waters of my blue demesne, chimed each sunset
on the wave! Sometimes, when I played my violin
far into the night, I saw ghostly shadows moving under
my lovely garden trees; then I knew that I had awakened
the wild people of another world, who came to
listen with delight to the Tusitala of the “magic-stick”
from the lands beyond the setting suns. Sometimes I
would invite Tamariki, Cenerita, and a few more sweet-minded
Samoan children to spend the evening with me.
They would sing part-songs, melodies of which none
knew the composer, wonderful strains that had been
mysteriously blown into some old Samoan musician’s soul
from the moonlit ocean caves. Crude as some of those
songs were, I heard the true note. Metaphorically speaking,
I threw all my music studies away. Away with
such rubbish! No western music ever thrilled me as I
was thrilled by the haunting poetry of wild sweet sounds
such as I heard on those Samoan nights. It often seemed
unbelievable, dream-like, when I sat on a fibre mat before
the limelight of the stars and whiffed the odours
of wild flowers and listened to the perfect strains of
that great University of Samoan elemental musical art.
Often when I heard the final chant of some musical
genius I would arise and cheer loudly, as the rough, tattooed
audience beat their drums and whistled their encores.
Sometimes a sun-varnished maid would stand
before the forest audience and sing some masterpiece
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>that expressed all the impassioned melody of music’s
far-away, forgotten childhood. I would hear the seawinds
sigh their long-drawn accompaniment across the
lovely wild-stringed harp of forest trees; a cloud would
pass away from the moon and so lift a great silver
curtain of ghostly light from the leafy, gnarled colonnades.
And then the dusky, star-eyed <i>prima donna</i> of
the forest would bow with a grace that was seemingly
quite out of place as one listened to the wild hubbub
of the fierce-eyed, tawny men who waved their arms as
they cheered from the orchestral stalls of jungle, bush,
and fern. Such sights, such experiences might well turn
the brain of a much more sober head than I claim to
possess.</p>

<p class='c023'>After leaving O Le Tao I came across a kind of South
Sea Mozart. He was a young Samoan of about fourteen
years. He possessed a cheap German fiddle, and on
its frayed strings extemporized melodies of the weirdest
beauty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s that song, Pango-Pango?” said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>He shook his curly head and said, “Me knower not,
nice songer camer me out of win’ (wind) of the forest,
from moan of sea-cave and stars of big sky-land.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>Saying that, he once more placed his fiddle (’cello
style) between his knees, and performed a melody that
might well have haunted the brain of a Brahms, a Schubert,
or an Elgar. He was a handsome little fellow,
with beautiful bird-like eyes. He was absolutely unconscious
of the gift he possessed. He seemed, to me,
the sun-varnished, perfect-limbed personification of Music
itself, Music’s youth, light-winged, passionate, beautiful
with elemental sweetness, the ecstasy of melancholy
and inartistic carelessness. He played to his shadow in
the lagoons. There was a fascinating witchery in all
his ways. Yet I doubt whether such a soul as Pango’s
could ever develop into that stage of music which men
call “Classic.” His genius was the genius of youth,
and could never grow old, and, rusting, develop into
the austere ossification of the fashionable musical cranium,
that awful unvibrant curvature of the musical spine
that seems the melody of beauteous youth. Pango was
as natural in his art as are the flowers and birds on the
hillside. He could never have attained that decrepitude
of imagination that invests itself in a robe of artistries,
making sad old men and women imagine they hear the
beautiful by having their unresponsive spines forcibly
shaken by the thunderous crash, the multitudinous rumble
and groan of artificial musical art. Ah, memory of
Pango! Though a true musician, he would have been
nowhere as a music-hall composer. Nor could he place
suggestive words to music. He lacked British spiciness,
too. But I vow that he <i>did</i> put the stars and forest
streams to music as he sat out on the promontory’s edge
by moonlight, looking like some young Grecian god as
he hummed and played a strain that sounded like infinity
in pain. To my great regret I lost sight of Pango-Pango
for quite a year after that. The fact is, I left
Samoa. How I left, and of the wonders of the sea, I
will tell in the next chapter.</p>

</div>
<p class='c017'>I ship with a genuine Old-time Crew—Poetic Nightmares—Tattooed
Manuscripts of the Seas!—I learn the
Art of Forcible Expression—Tar-pots—The Storm—Washed
Overboard—Papeete—Pokara—How the first

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c008'>THERE are many sceptics who may disbelieve my
account of the crew of the “Zangwahee,” but
away with such people!</p>
<p class='c009'>About a week after losing sight of Pango-Pango I
went across to Savaii Isle. I had heard that there was
an old sailing-ship anchored off Matautu, and that she
was bound on a long voyage across the Pacific. I shall
never forget the wonder I felt on first sighting the
“Zangwahee” as she lay out in the bay. “Looks like
an old Spanish galleon,” I thought, as I stared at the
yellowish canvas sails and the antiquated rigging imaged
in the dark-toned waters of the bay. For a moment I
eyed the outlines of that craft with intense curiosity.
The beautifully carven emblematical figure-head (a goddess
with outstretched praying hands) kept my eyes spellbound.
The poetry of the artist’s brain, the magic that
had inspired the human hands to carve such outlines,
seemed to enter my soul, as the light of the setting sun
touched the saffron-hued sails and glimmered across the
silent, blue lagoons. The movements of a man’s form
on her deck made me realize the truth; for in some
credulous fancy I had half thought that she was some
long-lost treasure-trove ship that had lain there for centuries!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>“Where you bound for?” I cried, hailing a weird-looking
seadog who had suddenly stared over the bulwark
side.</p>

<p class='c009'>Placing his hand to his lips, he yelled back, “Bound
for Tarhoyti!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where the h——’s Tarhoyti?” I yelled back. But
no response came; the old sailor simply pulled his dilapidated
cap over his eyes and spat melancholy-wise into
the ocean. In a few moments I had taken one of the
beach canoes and paddled out to the “Zangwahee.”
Clambering up the rope gangway, I went on board. As
I stood on deck, I stared in astonishment. The crew,
who were busy coiling up the ropes on deck, all stood
up, and looked like rows of mummies clad in rags.
They were wrinkled and sun-tanned to a yellowish hue!
They might have been the crew of the “Flying Dutchman,”
so weird did they look, those old-time sailormen.
And talk about blasphemous oaths, when I meekly asked
if they thought there was any chance of a job!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Captain Vanderdecken aboard?” I said, hoping to
break the ice by such an evident bit of humour on my
part. One old sailorman, who had a Rip Van Winkle
look about him, stared at my blue serge suit of the nineteenth
century, and then, touching his cap respectfullike,
said, “Thar’s the Ole Man aft; cawn’t ye see
’im?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Looking aft, I got a bit of a shock, I can tell you.
The skipper looked as ancient as his ship! He had a
monstrous grey beard and O, the expression on his face!
I might have made a bolt over the side but for the fact
that he had already spotted me. Going straight aft, I
looked him in the face and said, “Any chance of a job,
sir?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Metaphorically speaking, he picked me up by the heels,
smelt me, looked at my teeth, screwed my neck round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>twice, examined my spine, thumped me on the ribs, and
said, “<span class='sc'>Um!</span>”</p>

<p class='c009'>I fancied I saw the dust of ages on his bony neck as
a whiff of wind came across the Pacific and divided
the tresses of his beard. Then he looked down on the
deck and said, “Wha’s thawt?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“My violin, sir,” I responded, as curiosity toned
down much of the funk I was in.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ho ho! He he! Haw haw!” he yelled, as he
gazed on the deck at my fiddle-case. In obedience to his
commands, I at once took my instrument from its case
and commenced to play! It was like seeing God smile
as his wrinkled face lit up with delight. “Yoom’ll do,”
he said. Then, taking hold of me by the scruff of the
neck, he pitched me headlong down the alley-way into
the dingy cuddy (saloon). Alighting gently on a rather
soft-plushed settee of prehistoric pattern, I murmured my
thanks. You see, I had sailed on sailing ships and well
knew that the treatment I was receiving was of marked
courtesy in comparison with that which I had experienced
whilst on the Clipper Lines.</p>

<p class='c009'>So did I become a member of a crew who, I
should think, were the last of the genuine old seadogs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next day the yards were squared to a stiff, fair breeze,
and to the strain of some old Spanish chanty I found
myself bound for Tahiti! My description of this voyage
and the crew may appear like some gross exaggeration;
but I can assure the reader that I could not possibly
describe that crew and their ancient craft <i>without</i>
appearing to exaggerate. I even remember the thrill
that went through me when I saw the ancient-looking
yellowish sails belly to the Pacific wind as we passed
beyond the barrier reefs and caught the outer foam.
But alas! the thrill passed away when I sat down in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>forecastle with those marvellous old shellbacks and had
my first meal.</p>

<p class='c009'>I might say that the salt-horse and biscuits of the
“Zangwahee” were as ancient as the crew appeared to
be. Perhaps it was natural enough that there should
be an affinity between the ancient members of that crew
(a few members belonged to my own century) and the
horses that had apparently roamed the primeval Arabian
plains! Only a great poet could describe the antique
“Menu” of that forecastle. I have a brilliant imagination,
and so it was easy enough for me to imagine
that the corn that those biscuits were made of had ripened
in Assyrian cornfields! I only had to eat a foc’sle
biscuit to enter at once the realms of enchantment. Just
as good wine intoxicates the brain, the fumes of those
cast-iron mouldy biscuits created a gassy atmosphere in
my stomach and inspired my brain with weird poetic
fancies. I imagined I saw Ruth standing amid the “alien
corn”; and, taking another nibble, I had visions of old
rivers flowing by ancient walls, and of the desert towers
of the Pharaohs! I saw tired harvest girls, sickle in
hand, sleeping by their garnered heaps under Assyrian
suns. Yes, reader, such dreams were mine when I had
poetic nightmares after partaking of the “Zangwahee’s”
forecastle menu of salt-horse and hard-tack.</p>

<p class='c009'>Though I could fill reams with the wonders of the
“Zangwahee’s” menu and all that my brain fancied,
I have only space to set down the stern facts that apply
to the “Zangwahee’s” crew. As I’ve said, they were
hairy-chested men, real seadogs of another age. To see
their thick-bearded lips and their crooked noses, as they
sang and climbed aloft, made me half fancy that I had
been blown across a century into the Nelson period.
Notwithstanding the old skipper’s rough exterior, I found
him quite human. Surely few young men who have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>gone to sea have had the experiences I have had, for
that old skipper would get blind drunk, and, lying in
his bunk, roar mighty encores as I played selections on
my violin to him! He loved sea hymns, and, when I
played “For those in peril on the sea,” he would mumble
deep in his beard, his eyes becoming wet with tears!
Though I liked that strange old captain (and I believed
he liked me), my chief delight was to come off watch
and sit in the forecastle with the crew as they tugged
their beards, shook their fists, cursed the mate, the skipper,
and the Universe! As they sat on their sea-chests
in the dim-lit forecastle, they looked exactly what they
were—genuine high priests who worshipped at the altar
of monstrous yarns and the best rum!</p>

<p class='c009'>Some of them had fine, fierce, kind eyes, and bearded
lips that never tired of yelling forth the wild mystery
of the sea and oaths of inexhaustible beauty! They
were able to express, in one neat phrase, the pictorial
ruggedness of their adventurous, unholy careers. They
were true sea-poets—possessing forcible descriptive genius
that enabled one to conjure up weird visions of the
wondrous countries they had seen and the “charming”
women they had known. And I vow that they made
their verse scan, subtle verse devoid of any direct influence
from the idyllic school of romanticism. Some
hailed from ’Frisco, Japan, Callao, New York, London
Town, Norway, etc., so there was a splendid mixture of
the world’s maritime literature. Consequently that forecastle’s
audience made a terrific school of the “Sturm
und Drang” persuasion, a school that fairly hummed
with the unrestraint of Rousseau’s <i>Confessions</i>, at the
same time favouring Mallarmé and Browning for concentrated
expression. A forcible accent came on their
rhymes too! One epic punch-rhyme would make one’s
eyes see stars! What hairy fists they had! But those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>older hands seldom quarrelled. O Le Tao’s frame was
as bare as an egg when compared to the hieroglyphics
and tattooed sea-heraldry inscribed on their carcases. I
had never seen such living art before, such brazen display
as they revealed when they sat by their bunks
and undressed in that forecastle. Watching by the mingy
oil-lamp that hung from the fo’c’sle roof-beam, I seemed
to be witnessing some life-like, wondrous Madame Tussaud’s
waxwork of the sea, as one by one they pulled
their coats and vests off, revealing their herculean, muscular
frames in the nude! What a sight I beheld!—the
tattooed storied history of their adventurous careers! On
one old sea-weary sailor’s chest was engraved, in curves
of red and blue, a goddess-like girl, the one great romantic
love of his youth. She was exquisitely designed, and
one unloosed tress fell down to her bare shoulders. I
was fascinated as, leaning forward, I made out the
faint words inscribed beneath the feet—“My Lucille,”
then again, over the crown of hair, “Mizpah.” Others
were veritable living volumes, depicting all those things
that influence sailormen in the seaports of the world:
shapely-limbed maids of Shanghai, Tokio, Callao, ’Frisco,
New York, and London Town adorned their figures.
“My True love Harriet,” Lucille, Unita, Mary Ann,
Bill’s Alice, Ducky-Sarah, Angelina, Una, Fan-Tan, all
were there, pug-nosed, and some, alas, indelicately underclad.
I do not exaggerate when I say that I was initiated
into the storied, tragical history of the oceans,
of wrecks, the morals and poetic characteristics of strange
womenkind in distant lands, and the shattered hopes
of faithful sailormen, as I studied those weather-beaten
manuscripts of the seas. For many of those tattooesque
designs were sentimental symbols telling of fidelity in
love, some deep faith in “Alice, dated 1879,” and lo,
the recorded disillusionment with the later date—1880—the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>design of a heart with a dagger through it, revealing
something of the bitterness brought to those old sailors’
hearts through the faithlessness of those old loves
whose names were tattooed on their massive, hairy chests
and muscular arms! It would indeed be a weird chapter
of memoirs that told of my brazen explorations, of
my astonished exclamations, as I curiously scanned and
studied the tattooesque history of those violent old manuscripts.
Many of the inscriptions had faded with age.
Old Hans, who had sailed the seas fifty years, before
I was born, would yarn for hours as I frequently interrupted
to stare at his chest, his arms, wrists, and
fingers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who was she?” I’d ask.</p>

<p class='c009'>He would shake his head sadly and tell me how Unita
jilted him; how Kum-Kum slept in Tokio, and Leila in
Kensal Green, and Singa-Samber in some old cemetery
in the South Seas. Once he put forth his tarry thumbnail,
and by the mingy gleams of the fo’c’sle’s hanging
oil-lamp helped me to trace out a faint figure on his big
wrinkled chest, and, lo! I plainly discerned the face, legs,
and shoulders of some old pal hanging on a foreign gibbet!
I often thought that I must be dreaming it all,
as they sat there in the shadows, yarning away, as the
Pacific combers banged against the vessel’s side, and we
rolled along on our lonely course bound for old Papeete.
It took some time before that crew acknowledged me
as one of their legitimate members, for they were often
cantankerous devils.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ah, memory of it all—and my first oath! For, though
I had been many voyages and roughed it “on the wallaby”
with old sundowners in Australia and New Zealand,
I had not blossomed into a true sea-poet of the
great unromantic school of the oceans. No unfledged
<i>prima donna</i>, no débutante, ever rehearsed her first part
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>as I did, I know. <i>I’d</i> show them how to swear! After
deep meditation, I gathered together the finest swear
words extant. Over and over again I repeated those
vile phrases until they fell glibly, naturally, from my
tongue—full-blooded adjectives that resolved into monstrous
illegitimate pronouns that I may not print here!
I longed to publish those words, so to speak, to inflict
them, sear them on the soul of one of those cantankerous
old seadogs, for they played many scurvy
tricks upon me, such tricks as must remain unrecorded.
Though many opportunities presented themselves before
I got the swear-phrases off by heart, I had to wait quite
four days before I could get my own back in a legitimate
way. At last the desired moment came. It was
just at sunset. I was standing on deck gazing on the
horizon, admiring the expanse of peace, the ineffable
beauty of awakening stars and approaching night. Suddenly
the modern sailor, who hailed from a local pub,
Houndsditch, London, walked out of the forecastle,
looked at me as I stared over the bulwark, then yawned,
and dabbed me negligently—smash! in the mouth with
a coal-tar brush, and calmly asked me if “Me mother
knew I was out?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I clapped my hand to my tar-smeared face; then I
let forth my pent-up volley of oaths, which I well punctuated
with a splendid driving blow on that son of
Houndsditch’s nasal organ. The applause and calls of
encore from the whole crew, who had rushed up to see
the fight, were terrific. They cheered and cheered. Then
I gave them something more to cheer about—I picked
up the nearest tar-pot—there was a row of them by the
galley door—and crash! it fitted like a cap over my opponent’s
cranium, hiding his brow, eyes, nose, and mouth
too! It was splendid. The cheer that followed that unrehearsed
act of mine soothed my ruffled nerves considerably.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>I was declared the winner, and, metaphorically
speaking, was awarded on the spot the Nobel prize for
swearing! I gained and maintained the highest respect
from those seasoned sailormen. They nudged me in the
ribs when “Houndsditch” passed me on deck, and reviewed
my contributions to ocean-poetry in the most
friendly spirit as I swore and swore. So have I slowly
and painfully educated myself that I may compete with
my fellow-man and fight the world with my sleeves up.
I recall that I was quite comfortable on board after that
fight. Ah! I often think to myself, that if I were a king
or a millionaire, how I should purchase thousands of
tar-pots, and fix them—crash!—over the heads of some
people I know. But why digress to record one’s personal
viciousness? Except for the incidents recorded
it was a monotonous voyage; and I was delighted when
we caught a good trade wind and, with all sails set, the
“Zangwahee” fairly danced and bowed as she did her
ten knots toward old Papeete.</p>

<p class='c009'>I had been to Papeete before, so knew what I was
up against. I wasn’t touring the world with a camera
and a thousand a year; and, though “South Sea palm-clad
isles and wine-dark seas” sounds poetic and comfortable
like, you have to rough it a bit if you’ve only
got fourpence halfpenny in the exchequer. But these
facts didn’t trouble me overmuch, since I could play the
fiddle and swear.</p>

<p class='c009'>The cook of the “Zangwahee” was a most grotesque
character. He swore like the much-maligned trooper,
banged his pots and pans about, and behaved like a lunatic
when we stood by the galley door and held our noses,
as we cynically praised the terrible effluvia of the cooking
salt-horse. He, too, belonged to another age. He was
sun-tanned to a yellowish hue, and had a large, drooping
nose with bristly hair on the end. He would purse his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>lips up and, giving me a contemptuous glance as I smelt
the galley odours, would say: “You call yerself a saylorman!
yer God-damned galoot, clear art of it!” But in
the end he and I became quite chummy. He would sit
by his galley doorway and tell about the good old days,
curse the modern sailormen and seafaring ways, as I
agreed with all he had to say. “You orter been a-living
in <i>our</i> time, when men <i>was</i> sailors,” he’d say, as I softly
pressed him to take another sip of rum from the flask
which I always carried, so that I might with ease bribe
those dogmatic seafarers. After that he would cook a
small bit of salted horse in fresh water instead of sea-water
for my especial benefit. He even gave me fresh-made
biscuits at times. So did I manage to exist on
the “Zangwahee”; otherwise I should have been buried
over the side and gone out of this story years ago. When
rum was plentiful, the cook would stop on deck dancing
half the night. Through being bow-legged, he looked
like some mammoth frog clad in an apron, as he shuffled
in a jig in the moonlight, close by his galley door. The
songs he sang were quite tuneless, consequently he sang
and sang. He would fold his arms on his breast and
open his mouth like a puppet, as I played the violin and
he danced. I’ve never played an obligato to a frog’s
solo; but for tune and <i>tempo</i> give me the frog! (I don’t
think it’s usually known, but the Polynesian swamp frog
was the original inventor of the syncopated accent of
the modern cake-walk.) Its chant goes:</p>

<p class='c021'>And to sit in a South Sea forest by moonlight and hear
an old marsh-frog conduct an orchestra composed of
the weird denizens of the forest—the Samoan nightingale
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>wrapt in its green and bluish velvet robe, singing
exquisitely as <i>prima donna</i>, the mosquitoes buzzing on
their weird flutes, while the grey, swallow-tailed gnat,
sitting on the tall fern-spray, sweeps majestic strains
from its wondrous violin, as the old forest trees waltz—is
a musical treat and sight to be ever remembered.</p>
<p class='c009'>It is wonderful what we mortals can see and hear
when we keep our inward ears and eyes wide open. Of
course, such sights were as nothing to me; I had long
since realized that the great truths of this world exist
outside the realms that men persist in erroneously dubbing
“Reality.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was an engrossing spectacle to watch those old-time
sailors dance on deck by moonlight. The very
winds in the sails seemed to sing an eerie accompaniment,
as the weird old shellbacks jigged and tossed their
arms to the moon. I’d play the fiddle, as the strain of
“Oh, oh for Rio Grande!” came ghost-like from the
dancers’ bearded lips. It looked as though they were
the ragged phantom crew of a ghostly ship, as they shuffled
on deck, their sea-boots going “Tip-er-te-tap-tum-per-te-thump-thump!”
their eyes bright with merriment,
as they opened their big, tuneless mouths and joined in
the chorus. Then a cloud would suddenly pass across
the moon’s face, and lo, puff! they had all vanished, gone,
blown overboard!</p>

<p class='c009'>I’d stare aghast, and see lumps of ragged clothes and
misty stuff, like remnants of old beards, swept off on
the night winds, as their parchment-like hands clutched
in vain at the clouds in space!</p>

<p class='c009'>Some unimaginative folk might have sworn that it
was nothing more than hovering albatrosses asleep on
the wing, floating on the wind. But still, it’s a weird
place is the South Sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>However, in the morning, there they were, all in their
<span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>bunks, fast asleep, or half awake, dipping their swollen
heads in buckets of cool sea-water—as real as real could
be!</p>

<p class='c009'>With all that voyage’s discomforts I found it in no
way monotonous. For that forecastle was a wonderful
breathing library of stirring adventure. The characters
of the books walked about, talked, and took mighty oaths
if one dared to doubt their veracity.</p>

<p class='c009'>I often marvelled how any shipping-office officials came
to engage such ancient-looking sailormen. They looked
infirm and useless. I sometimes half fancy that I
dreamed them, or that I am quite a thousand years old,
as they come to me in some memory of the night, and
dance till I distinctly hear their sea-boots tapping on my
bedroom floor in this old inn. Olaf was clean-shaven,
and was so wrinkled and tanned that he looked like some
neptuonic mummy clad in modern duck-pants and a
belt. Steffan wore a peculiar-shaped bristly beard round
his neck only, which looked like an old, frayed, grey
woolly scarf, a fixture round his throat. Hans, the boatswain,
who always said “Thou canst,” and “thee,” and
“shiver-me-timbers,” would look straight into the mate’s
eyes and say, “Avast there, you lubber!” He had one
enormous tooth that protruded from his compressed lips,
which seemed ever grinning, were he awake or asleep.
At other times he would remind me of a wonderfully
carved heathen idol, a kind of South Sea Laocoön that
I had once seen in a tambu-house in New Guinea. For
he would stand on deck bathing in a large tub that hardly
reached to his knees, his muscles and veins swollen, vividly
standing out as though through some mental and
physical agony, while he stared on the skyline, then once
again scanned his tanned arms and chest, whereon were
tattooed the strange names of women he had known!
Olwyn Saga, who wore a beard that brushed against his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>hips and where through the winds whistled eerie melodies
when storms blew, had cornflower-blue eyes that had
ogled the women of Shanghai and Callao before any
modern sailor was born.</p>

<p class='c009'>Even the skipper would tug his huge beard in a kind
of meditative way whenever he met Olwyn on deck.
As for the mate, a Scot, he almost apologized before
shouting out his orders to those grand old fathers of
the sea. Even their songs sounded like echoes from another
age, as the old fo’c’sle dog, Moses, sat upright before
them, tears coursing down his cheeks as the strains
seemingly awakened memories of other days. And when
Olwyn jigged in the forecastle by night, the hands would
sit huddled on their sea-chests, their chins leaning on their
horny hands as they dreamily watched. And I would
fiddle a weird obligato, shivery-like, as I stood beneath
the fo’c’sle’s oil-lamp, playing, not to Olwyn’s dancing
figure, but to his shadow that mimicked him as it bobbed
up and down in the gloom of the bunks and wooden bulwark
side, first to port and then to starboard, as, folding
his arms under his beard, he slewed round and round!
Only the shuffling sounds of the big sea-boots, “Tump-er-te-tump-er-thump-er-te-thump,”
told of the reality, as
I, avoiding Olwyn and staring at his silently moving
shadow in the gloom, was enabled to feed my imagination
and extemporize an eerie accompaniment to a melody
that had been sung on the Spanish Main a century
before.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was in the hush of the hot, calm, tropic night, when
the “Zangwahee” wallowed in the swell and plomped
till the hanging canvas seemed to be drumming to the
destiny of the marching stars, that I blessed those aged
sailormen. For, as they yarned and yarned, telling of
their far-off experiences, my admiration for them became
unbounded. They were either the most glorious old liars
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>that ever existed, or had lived in Olympian times when
nothing was impossible and only the marvellous occurred.
Treasure-troves, typhoons, scented merchandise from the
Indies, faithless lovers, dusky beauties on mysterious uncharted
isles, and God knows what else, haunted my
dreams, as I, at last, fell asleep, with their voices still
mumbling in my ears. Old Hans, who smoked a filthy
terra-cotta clay pipe and gassed me into insensibility
on nights of sad rememberings, took a fancy to me. I
became quite interested in the lonesome dog-watches. I’d
sit by his bunk, and he’d point to the faded pictures of
the foreign women he’d known and shake his head.
“When did she die, Hans?” I’d say, as I pointed to
one of the faded outlines of his bunk’s photographs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She?—why, shipmate, she died ages ago!” Then
I’d hear all about the reality of that shadowy outline
on the wooden wall. So did I become familiar with
the inner dramas of those old sailors’ lives. Sometimes
I’d hear things that made a shiver go down my spine,
or, rather, down where the remnants of my spinal column
remained, for the mate had surely broken it in
three places (I had experienced so much in my travels
that it did not seem strange that I should go off to sea
in search of romance and lose my spine).</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must be mighty old, Hans, to have experienced
such things,” I ventured to say, as he yarned on one
night. Then, so that he might see that I wasn’t as green
as he appeared to think I was, I added, “Might you
have met Abraham or any of the Pharaohs in your
time?”</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment he puffed his antique pipe, his fingers
toiling away as he stitched the fragments of his ancient
clothing together; for quite a while longer his chin
pressed his white beard against his chest, as he sat in
an attitude of deep thought. Then I distinctly observed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>an amused twinkle shoot into his pale blue eyes, as, solemnly
shaking his head, he replied, “No, I’ve never
’eard of them coves; they muster ’ave been born <i>after</i>
my time!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you mean to tell me that you’re older than Abraham?”
I said quietly.</p>

<p class='c009'>Hans looked steadily at me, then gave me a solemn
nudge in the ribs. And then I knew that old Hans
had been a bit of a humorist in his youth, ages ago!
I didn’t cotton to Steffan as keenly as I did to Hans.
The fact is, he would get drunk and shout all through
the night, mind you:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Blow! blow! bully boys, blow—O!</div>
      <div class='line'>We’re bound, bound for Callao—O!</div>
      <div class='line'>We, the sailormen of long ago—O!</div>
      <div class='line'>So let the winds roar what they know—O!</div>
      <div class='line'>Blow! blow! bully boys, blow—O!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c018'>Then he’d finish up by expectorating a stream of tobacco
juice right through the port-hole on the figure-head’s dishevelled
hair! (It is only the callow youth who sees
the poetry and romance of carven wood.) But even
Steffan became emotional when he opened his sea-chest
and took forth his old tattered love-letters. It seemed
unbelievable as I listened to the soft, sweet things romantic
girls of eastern lands had written in praise of Steffan’s
eyes, tender ways, and figure! Then he would fold each
tattered yellow fragment up, and moan with the winds
outside in the foremast rigging, as tears coursed down
his wrinkled cheeks! I think it was when the skipper
mustered the crew for prayers, aft in the cuddy, that
those old sailormen appeared the most emotional. It
was quite evident by their voices that they believed in
a Supreme Being’s watchful care over the lot of old
sailormen. I would play the fiddle as they stood by the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>cuddy’s table, prayer-book in hand, lifting their sea-weary
eyes mournfully, as their voices rose and fell.
What voices! Mellow and sombre with years, the deep
bass notes seemed to come from beneath the deck under
their feet and echo through their beards. The skipper,
divested of all his erstwhile blasphemy, would hit the
cuddy’s table with his knuckles as he tried to keep the
<i>tempo</i> and the language the same (they sang in various
tongues). And one night, when they all stood singing
with their huddled backs bent, and the cuddy’s dim lamp
swung to and fro sending glimmerings over their wrinkled
faces, I seemed to have suddenly passed into a bygone
age. “Houndsditch” and the two other modern
sailors were mysteriously blown, like cobweb figures, out
of the saloon by a puff of wind. Only those eight hairy-chested,
tattooed figures stood there, looking like misty
things with hollow eyes and eerie grey beards, as they
sang a hymn that strangely echoed up in the wailing sails.
The tap, tap of the skipper’s knuckles on the cuddy table
sounded afar off. I heard only the long, low plunge of
the “Zangwahee’s” bows as she roamed onward and the
praying hands of the figure-head swerved, dived, or
softly lifted towards the tropic skies, while I stared across
the little swaying table, fiddling to the voices of those
old sailors, as we sailed the dim, starlit seas of romance!</p>
<p class='c009'>One night, while we were playing cards in the dogwatch,
something struck the “Zangwahee” like a tremendous
hammer-blow. We were carrying a lot of canvas
at the time. The “Zangwahee” heeled over and
tumbled us in a heap on the port side of the forecastle.
The boatswain’s dog, old Moses, a huge, fluffy fellow
with fine brown eyes that were full of wisdom, rushed
out on deck and barked at the stars. Moses was always
alert, being the first to obey the mate’s orders. In a
moment we had followed Moses on deck in a regular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>stampede. The mate was yelling and swearing like a
madman.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where the blazing h—— are ye, mon? Take in
sail; she’ll have the masts ripped out of her!” (The
mate seldom gave direct orders to those old sailormen
who had run the Easter down and doubled Cape Horn
before he was at his mother’s breast!)</p>

<p class='c009'>That typhoon had struck us without the slightest warning.
The “Zangwahee” was already diving, as I clambered
aloft with the rest of the crew. The seas, calm
as a sheet of glass when the sun went down, were heaving
angrily as the wind howled across the night. It
was a marvellous and grand sight, for there wasn’t a
cloud in the sky. The stars were flickering as though
the typhoon’s wild breath reached to the remote outer
spaces of infinity. As I crawled along the foot-ropes
aloft, I looked down on the “Zangwahee’s” swaying
decks and distinctly saw old Moses barking as he stared
aloft, his hairy nose sniffing the stars. I looked seaward
and saw the ramping seas rolling away to the dim night
skylines like travelling mountains. As we fisted the canvas,
the old skipper roared his orders from the poop;
his beard blew upward and went over his shoulders as
the wind struck him. Of course, up there aloft we got
the full force of the blast. I clung on like grim death.
We had to keep our faces to leeward, otherwise it were
impossible to breathe at all, as the wind struck us like
a solid mass. I cursed that typhoon. I hadn’t any diplomas
for ability in going aloft on dark nights while typhoons
blew. Besides, I had a swollen face through
toothache. I felt as though I was being tossed about
in space, lost in an infinity of wind and darkness, with
only the stars around me.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Old ’ard! yer son of a gun!” roared an old salt,
as I clutched the canvas with one hand and grabbed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>his beard with the other when the “Zangwahee” nearly
turned turtle. It was Olwyn Saga, and for a moment
I had thought that a kind, vast white beard had been
thrust out of space, until I heard the mouth give a muffled
oath. Only one who has been aloft on a sailing-ship
in really bad weather knows the sensation one feels
when one hangs on to the taut ropes of a stick that
seems to wobble in space, a stick with a dozen singing
sailors clinging to it, using frightful oaths as they apparently
grab the stars and curse, when they should be
thinking of the supreme possibility of suddenly appearing
before their Maker.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Avast there! Shiver-me-timbers! What yer doing,
yer young B——!” seemed to groan a sepulchral bearded
voice from out the stars!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing,” I wailed, as the vessel, pooping a tremendous
sea, seemed to dive over the rim of the world into
an abyss. I had instinctively clutched the nearest solid
portion of the visible universe—the seat of the aged
boatswain’s pants! And still those old salts sang some
strange chanty as we see-sawed to and fro in space.
The moon had just risen, blood-red on the horizon, sending
a wild glow over the storm-tossed waters. And,
as I looked down from my perch in space, I saw the
tremendous seas lifting their oily backs, like mammoth
monsters, as they chased and charged the staggering
ship. The skipper was still on the poop, using his hands
as a siren, as he yelled to the winds apparently. Suddenly
a tremendous smudge seemed to obliterate the
world, a smudge that incarnadined the ocean. The
“Zangwahee” rose like a leaping stag, then fell. Even
the seasoned salts clinging beside me ceased their eternal
chanty at that awful moment. Crash! the “Zangwahee”
had apparently collided with the blood-red moon! I
distinctly saw the outstretched praying hands of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>emblematical figure-head as the jibboom dived and then
stabbed the moon, and I went head-over-heels and fell
softly into the moon’s ghostly fires! So did it all seem
to me, as the “Zangwahee” nearly foundered, and I,
in some inexplicable double-somersault, had a swift
glimpse of the horizon, as she fell between the mountainous
seas and I was jerked into old Olwyn’s arms. I saw
the great living walls of foam-lashed waters flying past
us. For one moment the foretop-gallant yard seemed
exactly level with the foaming pinnacles of the mountains
of water that were travelling S.W. But for Olwyn’s
providential grip on me, I should surely have fallen
from aloft, that I know. I thanked Heaven when everything
was snug aloft and we all carefully descended the
rattlings. I recall that I had barely got my bare feet
on the bulwark side, prior to jumping down on deck, when
another sea struck us. Again it seemed that we had
foundered and that the waters were thundering over
our heads, ramping along, shrieking with delight as we
awaited the trump of doom. When the “Zangwahee”
once more righted herself, we picked the skipper up as
he lay by the galley amidships. He had been washed
off the poop. By some miracle the man at the wheel
had been able to stick to his post, and so had managed
to keep the “Zangwahee” from falling broadside on
into the tremendous seas. The chief mate helped to
carry the skipper aft and lay him in his bunk. His
leg had been broken. Suddenly old Hans wailed out
in a horror-stricken voice, “By the soul of Neptune, if
my old Moses ain’t gone overboard!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The huddled crew stood by the cuddy’s alley-way,
white-faced as they stared over the wild waters. The
swollen moon’s wild red light, sweeping the mountainous
seas, made a glow that somehow harmonized with
the intense inner drama, the sorrow of that moment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>The faithful eyes of that comrade, who had stood sentinel
by their bunks, were out there, staring blindly in
the engulfing cataclysms of those terrible night waters.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Shiver-me-timbers!” breathed forth those ancient
men, as it came again—a faint, deep, baying sound out
of the night, “Wough! Wough!”</p>

<p class='c009'>That familiar sound touched the very heart-strings
of those ancient sailormen. “God ’elp us all, me shipmate’s
overboard!” said Hans to the chief mate. The
“Zangwahee” rose on a mountainous sea; then once
more we shipped heavy water. The torn sails of the
mizzen-yard flapped, booming like big drums, as those
old seadogs stood there looking into each other’s eyes.
As for old Hans, he had never looked so appealingly
or spoken in so abject a way to a modern officer before.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment the clear eyes of “Scotty,” for so they
called the mate, stared on Hans. He was hesitating. In
that supreme moment he was the true monarch of that
buffeting little empire of wooden planks on an infinity
of water. His humble subjects awaited the order that
would prove if his heart glittered with the true stuff
that would stamp him as a man in their eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Though the first force of the typhoon had blown itself
out, the “Zangwahee” was pitching terrifically, and
to lower a boat on such a night was a risky thing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’E’s been a good shipmate to us, sor,” said another,
as Hans watched the mate’s face and clutched his vast
beard that had blown backward right over his shoulder.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I dinna ken what to do, mon; the skapper wouldnae
think on’t, I know,” said the mate, as he lifted his oilskin
cap and scratched his red head. Then he looked
into Hans’s eyes and said quietly, “All right, mon, lower
No. 3 starboard boat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Possibly the mate remembered that old Moses had
always obeyed him and pulled the blanket off his bunk
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>true to time when the midnight hot coffee was ready.
Even at that supreme moment a faint, deep, anguished
baying called to him out of the night. It was as though
Moses’ wondrous instinct knew that he was something
of an outsider in a world of two-legged men, and so
might be left to his fate. In a moment the old hands
had scampered to No. 3 boat. Their hearts were out
on those dark thrashing waters. They cared not one
iota about the risk they took that night. The great loneliness
of the ocean and the wild poetry of the storm
only strengthened the link of fellowship between them
and the brown eyes that stared from those seas at the
flying, storm-tossed “Zangwahee.” I had more than
once seen men lower a boat to save a man overboard,
and I swear that there was no less determination and
eagerness displayed by those old salts when they struggled
with the tackle and risked the tremendous seas in
lowering that boat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Give a hand there, youngster!” yelled Olwyn, as I
clung to the davits and did my best to help them. Then,
just before they lowered away, I jumped into the boat
to give Hans his clasp-knife to cut some tangled tackle.
It was at that moment that one of the men, who was
watching for the critical moment to lower away, saw his
chance, and loosened the tackle, and I found myself
numbered with the old salts in that boat. For a moment
I thought we had been swamped, for, as the boat
touched the back of the great oily sea that lifted the
“Zangwahee” till she heeled over as though she would
turn turtle, another sea struck her. But those old sea-poets
were not amateurs: they knew how to make the
seas scan and the rolling waters rhyme to their requirements.
But still for a long time we all had to use our
whole strength to keep the boat’s head to the seas. It
was then that I discovered, for the first time, that, though
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>the moon was well up on the horizon, a terrible darkness
existed in the gulfs of the waves. Once, when our
tiny craft rode buoyantly on the top of a tremendous
sea, I got a swift kaleidoscopic glimpse of the “Zangwahee’s”
swaying masts and rigging, far-off, with the
blood-red moon just behind her. The sight of those illimitable
miles of tossing waters, our lonely ship and
lonelier castaway boat, the frantic, hoarse calls of the
boat’s crew, calling “Moses! Moses!” was something unforgettable,
to be remembered when old ambitions and
natural catastrophes are long forgotten.</p>

<p class='c009'>No reply came to that frantic call. Not a soul spoke
as we all listened, down there in the silence of the hollows,
while the wind shrieked overhead and we dropped
into the sheer silence, as vast walls of living waters
rose around us. So strangely silent was it down there
in that gulf of the ocean, that I distinctly heard the deep
breathing of the sailors as they strained at the oars. At
last we heard it come again, that faint deep baying of
our struggling canine shipmate. There was no fancy
about it; we heard the wild note of appeal and despair
in each faint, deep bark that answered us between the
intervals of silence and the crash of the seas.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Damn the moon!” groaned the boatswain, as he
stood by the tiller, stared around him, and almost wept.
We all knew that, had the moon been high in the sky,
we should have had a thousand better chances of rescuing
Moses.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yell, boys! Bully boys, yell!” roared Hans. And
by faith they did yell. Again they listened and stared
out over the wild waters. Back it came—a faint response,
very faint. It was evident that, through the
heavy seas repeatedly washing over our shipmate’s head,
he was fast becoming weak, and so less able to resist
the onrush of the travelling seas that would bear him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>from us for ever. “Shout again, boys!” said Hans.
And again we shouted. We well knew that it was the
only chance. For Moses would instinctively hear from
which direction our voices came and swim towards us.
It was then, whilst we all strained at the oars, and listened,
that we heard a faint, far-off cry of anguish. It sounded
more like the terrified cry of a human being than anything
else I could think of. Every face blanched, I
know, as we heard that last faint, terrified scream! Old
Hans, who stood by the tiller, his eyes looking quite
glassy, nearly fell over the side in his eagerness to see
what had happened. Indeed, the boat was nearly
swamped, for we left off rowing when we realized that
something else had come out of the vast night in answer
to poor old Moses’, our shipmate’s, despairing appeal to
us. We knew that the Pacific was infested by grey-nosed
sharks. We had caught three monsters on a hook
with fat pork only a day or two before. I know that we
all shivered at that moment. We well knew that Moses
would give a scream like that only if <i>one</i> thing happened.</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c009'>Next night, as the “Zangwahee” once again stole
steadily on her course, I sat in the fo’c’sle with those
strange old sailormen. There they sat, huddled on their
sea-chests, smoking their pipes and chewing melancholy-wise,
shuffling the cards as though they played a game
that was part of their destiny. Even their silhouettes,
moving on the wooden walls as the swinging oil-lamp
sent its mingy gleams on the low table, looked strangely
mournful as the big-bearded mouths drew in tobacco
smoke and blew it forth again in clouds. The boatswain,
old Hans, had torn his Bible in half and used shocking
atheistical expressions. I heard the tramp, tramp of the
look-out man just overhead, and the wail of the rigging
and heavy foremast canvas as the “Zangwahee” crept
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>along to the pushing hands of the night winds. Then
old Hans lifted his bowed head and looked towards the
fo’c’sle doorway, where old Moses, night after night,
had sat on his mat, on watch, his hairy nose pointing
to the stars as we slept in our bunks. I heard the old
sailor give a muffled oath as he blew his nose in his dirty
bit of sailcloth handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the cook closed the galley door for the night
and, stepping softly into the fo’c’sle, plumped down a
large jar of the best Jamaica rum on Hans’ sea-chest.
It was a present from the bed-ridden skipper; and, as
the old salts slowly opened their mouths and in one melancholy
gulp gave a sad toast to the memory of Moses’
soul, I once more seemed to be voyaging across the seas
of some far-off age. I heard the melodies of the winds
wailing aloft in the grey sails that swayed along under
the stars. And, somehow, I felt the touch of the sea’s
old sorrow and romance blow across the deck. The
moonlight was falling in an eerie way through the spread
canvas and wavering ghostly-wise on the deck just by
the fo’c’sle doorway. Again I felt that visionary presence,
as it rustled like a richly melancholy-scented wind
along the deck, a something that my senses could not
place. I felt it creep into the fo’c’sle, sending its shifting
fingers tenderly over the bowed heads of those old-time
sailormen, who mourned the loss of Moses, the
one who had instinctively loved them all, through knowing
the hidden virtue of their hearts.</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c009'>When we arrived off Papeete, we seemed to have
dropped anchor in some celestial harbour of a world
beyond the stars. Dotted about along the shore, under
the waveless coco-palms, were tiny, yellow wickerwork,
bamboo huts. The sun was setting. It was a sight to
please the most unpoetical being, as dusky figures, clad
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>in tappa-cloth and sashes of gorgeous hues, flitted under
the banyan groves. The far-away background of that
island world looked like some vast canvas daub, some
tremendous transcendent silence lit up by a liquid setting
sun. The mountain ranges of Orehena, visible for
miles, resembled some old chaos of unhewn creation
stuffed, piled up, overgrown with forests, and encircled
by the distant blue pigment of the ocean skyline. But
the savage children of Adam and Eve were there right
enough. Fleets of outrigger canoes were being paddled
out by the primitive peoples who had sighted the “Zangwahee.”
Those canoes were the Tahitians’ tiny argosies,
and were crammed with sweet-scented merchandise,
coco-nuts, limes, softly-tinted shells, corals, and luscious
fruits. Those merchants of the south clambered up the
vessel’s side, rushed about the decks gabbling in a musical
tongue that was the more fascinating through being
strange to our ears. Some were in such haste that they
dived from their canoes into the sea, and, leaping on
deck, looked like bronzed mermen as they shook themselves.
The water glistened from their lime-dyed locks
and ran down their handsome figures. “Yarana!” was
their oft-reiterated salutation. It was hard to tell which
were the most attractive, the pretty maids with hibiscus
blossoms in their curly hair, or the handsome terra-cotta-coloured
youths. Whilst the hubbub and general pandemonium
of those pretty merchants were in full swing,
old Hans, Olwyn, Steffan, Olaf, and the rest of the old
salts walked solemnly out of the forecastle, hired a
twelve-seated outrigger from the natives, and were immediately
paddled ashore.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was at that moment that I sighted for the first time
the old Tahitian chief, Pokara. So tall was he that he
overtopped the gabbling crowd who stood on the “Zangwahee’s”
deck. He was a handsome, wrinkled old fellow,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>and his looks did not belie him, for he was a mighty
heathen poet and philosopher. Though old, he stood
there in his resplendent youth of seventy summers, his
eyes ashine with the light of some witchery and fond
beliefs shared by no one else. Pokara, was one of a type
who are born old and grow up youthful. The blue days,
and the death-blood of some thousands of sunsets down
his seventy years had mellowed his faith in human things,
sent the dross to the winds, leaving him a simple-minded,
grand old man. But, withal, directly Pokara sighted my
face, he made a bee-line for me. His fine bronze figure
was almost hidden, so heavily laden was he with his
scented merchandise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You nicer white boy, me know!—me know!” said
he, as he dropped his bundles, crash! at my feet. Then
he continued, “Wise old Pokara say to ’imself, as soon
as he jumper on ship, ah, there stand ’ansome nicer
Englis’ boy; he gotter nicer face and alle-same-ee know
that kind old Pokara am here to sell tings bemarkable
cheap.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After finishing that flattering oration, the old Tahitian
drew back a few steps so that he might the better renew
his scrutinizing glance over my youthful physiognomy.
A second look at my face seemed to make the old chief
fairly chuckle to himself. I must have appeared a tenderfoot!
He behaved as though he would have me know
that he had, by a still more careful study of my features,
discovered hitherto undreamed-of virtues and beauty in
myself, such virtues that had quite escaped his notice
during his first hasty glance of admiration!</p>

<p class='c009'>Majestically waving away the other scrambling native
pedlars with his hand, he said, “Ha! Ha! Yorana!”
So how could I do otherwise than purchase a few things
that I did not want from that artful old man? I tell
these things concerning my introduction to Pokara, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>he was a typical Tahitian pedlar, a child in his
duplicity, and a fine sample of his race. But Pokara
was a child in more ways than one. He was a genuine
survival of the heathen days, and his mind was a veritable
repository of old legends, star-myths, and the
storied history of shadowland. He was a mighty actor
by nature, and, withal, was level-headed and good-hearted.
Consequently I never regretted meeting him
that evening on the “Zangwahee” decks, or at any time
during my lengthy stay in Papeete.</p>

<p class='c009'>I recall that, after I left the “Zangwahee,” I secured
a good position as first violinist in the French Presidency
orchestra, which I took under my leadership and made
into a capital string band. Monsieur le President allowed
me a good salary from the official exchequer, and
this established me firmly on my feet. But, alas for
the foolishness of unsatisfied youth! I tired of success
and went a-wandering. But I must admit, and on my
own behalf, that Pokara was at the bottom of that business,
for I suddenly met him again and got under his
pleasing influence. First, I must say that I was in a
somewhat melancholy mood that day. The night before,
and by the merest chance too, I had seen the last of
the “Zangwahee’s” crew. I had just emerged from the
Presidency midnight ball, my violin in my hand, thinking
to go straight home to my lodgings (an old hut at
the end of the township), for, as I have said, it was close
on midnight. A glorious full moon was shining over the
palm-clad mountains as I hurried on; but it so happened
that, after all, I did not return to my diggings till daybreak.
For, as I stared between the huddled spaces of
the thick clumps of bamboos, I caught sight of some
eight ragged-looking human beings attired in ancient
seamen’s clothes and antique cheesecutter caps. They
turned out to be none other than the “Zangwahee’s”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>crew on their last night ashore. There they were, old
Hans with vast beard leading the way, Steffan, Olaf,
Olwyn, the cook, and the rest walking one behind the
other in solemn Indian file under the palms, as they made
for the nearest café that sold the cheapest and best rum
and cognac. And as we all sat together in the shanty
by the mountains, the hills round Papeete rang with the
echoes of the wild sea chanties of an age that I had never
known, while they yarned and sang and drank solemnly
at my expense. Old Joffre, the night gendarme, and the
sleepless natives came and stood by the café’s doorway,
and stared in wonder as those old salts smacked me on
the back and yelled many lamentations over their farewells.
For I had told them that I had decided not to
return to the “Zangwahee” any more. I was truly
sorry to see the last of them. They had admitted me to
their distinctive social circle, had initiated me into the
poetic art of looking backward into a seemingly remote
past, and, above all, they had flavoured my soul with a
dash of the romance and true poetry of the sea that still
wandered on the oceans in the shape of peculiar, old,
tattooed men, when I was a boy.</p>

<p class='c009'>But to resume about Pokara. After leaving those
old salts, I happened to be strolling beneath the coco-palms
by Motoa beach, a lonely spot by the lagoons outside
Papeete. I was standing by the wooden-columned
portico of a forest shanty listening to the tuneless chuckling
of the blue-winged parakeets, when I was startled
by seeing a handsome, silent figure standing beneath a
palm tree. It was alive, for the full dark eyes blinked
as they stared towards the mountains. The magnificently
curved shoulders were squared to their full width,
a tappa-sash of gorgeous colour swathed the waist and
was tied bow-wise at the left hip, the tasselled end flung
gracefully over the right shoulder. The figure exactly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>resembled a bronze statue. The left knee was bent
slightly forward, and one hand was on the chin as the
eyes stared in deep meditation. The pose was perfect.
Had a handsome Greek statue suddenly stepped down
from its pedestal and gripped my hand in friendship
I could not have been more astonished. That figure was
none other than old Pokara, shorn of his cumbersome
merchandise and clad in the full festival costume of
ancestral chiefdom. His eagle-like eyes had seen me coming
down the orange groves!</p>

<p class='c009'>The old chief bent forward on one knee, and, seizing
my hand, pressed it fervently to his lips. I discovered
that the little wooden building by the palms was the
residence of a native friend of his, whom he had just
left after a visit. For a while we walked together, then
at my suggestion we went away over the slopes and
retired into a café and had a drink. Lord Pokara and
I became staunch friends. I found that he was looked
upon by all the natives, and by the white settlers too,
as a character worth knowing. His majestic bearing
was not the least of his attractive attributes. Though
his face was wrinkled into a deep, expressive map by
Time’s toiling hand, his terra-cotta-hued shoulders, well
greased with coco-nut oil, were as smooth as a youth’s.
His thick head of hair was undoubtedly grey; but Pokara
was “up to snuff,” and had checkmated Time’s
tell-tale pigment by dying his locks to a golden hue with
strong coral lime. He had evidently been a gay cavalier
in his earlier days, for I observed that when the
picturesque Tahitian maids passed us on the forest track,
all chanting their <i>himines</i> (legendary melodies), he returned
their coquettish glances without stint, negligently
tossing his shoulder-sash. Nor must we blame old Pokara
for his love of sensuous beauty, for he was very
old then and so must be sleeping soundly to-night.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>“You stopper at Papeete?” said he, as we finished
our drink and came out of the café.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” I replied; and this answer of mine seemed to
give him immense satisfaction.</p>

<p class='c009'>I saw Pokara almost daily after that, and I vow that
it was chiefly his wondrous personality and its effect on
my youthful mind that made me leave the Presidency
orchestra and take to troubadouring with the old Tahitian
chief.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You comer with me and play violin in villages a
longer way off, and we make lots of money,” said he
one day, after I had been down at his primitive homestead.
Then he began to tell me <i>Arabian Nights</i> tales
concerning the riches of the native villages and the wonders
to be seen in the pagan citadels over the mountains.
And so it happened that we went off together.
It was a glorious day when I found myself tramping
with my violin strung beside me, crossing the palm-clad
slopes of Mount Orehena, <i>en route</i> for the pagan villages
where dwelt great high-caste chiefs and chiefesses.</p>

<p class='c009'>It seemed like some wild dream of a mediæval age
when I first stood in a pagan township playing my violin
to dark-eyed, dusky houris. They stood with finger to
their hushed lips as I played by their bamboo huts and
Pokara sang a weird <i>himine</i>. I might say here that
Pokara had made me memorize several quaint heathen
tunes before we started off on that expedition, as well
as telling me monstrous tales about princes and chiefs
who would cast pearls at my feet as prolifically as one
throws rice on a happy marriage morn. But, alas! it
was not all as rosy as my Tahitian comrade had painted
it. And I thanked Heaven that the expenses attached
to the rôle of troubadouring were not over-abundant in
those glorious climes. Beyond languishing glances from
the star-eyed, golden-skinned Tahitian belles, I did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>get much out of the adventure; but I must admit that
the sight of Pokara, with his tasselled sash flung gracefully
over his tawny shoulder and a fascinating poetic
grin on his wrinkled mouth, was something worth sweating
across those tropic miles for in far-off Tahiti. I know
that Pokara seemed to look upon that trip as the time
of his life, as he passed round amongst our dusky audiences
with his coco-nut-shell collecting-box. Often the
old chiefs would persuade us to stay the night in the
village, so that we might serenade them at their sacred
festival rites and wedding ceremonies. And for such
services we would receive the highest honours and valuable
curios—tappa-cloth, pearl shells, and many things
that would make a heavy load. Pokara managed to get
hold of two large sacks, and, filling them with our presents,
had the cheek to ask me to carry one. But this
I positively refused to do, whereupon Pokara hid his
booty in the jungle till such time as he could come back
and fetch it.</p>

<p class='c009'>I think we had been on this South Sea buskin march
for about three weeks when we arrived at a pagan citadel
where we had quite an exciting adventure,—though,
in good truth, we had many adventures that may not be
recorded here. One night, after we had been tramping
miles through breadfruit forests and by the rugged feet
of lines of mountains, we came to a pagan citadel called
Ta-e-mao. I shall never forget the surprise of the dusky
inhabitants as we emerged from beneath the palms and
I began to play an old Tahitian madrigal, while Pokara
wailed out words that I did not understand. I was attired
in duck pants and a brass-bound midshipman’s reefer
jacket, and had on my head a large, dilapidated helmet
hat. As for Pokara, though he was travel-stained and
perspiration had washed much of the gold pigment from
his ambrosial locks, he was a sight fitted to awaken admiration
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>in all hearts. After the inhabitants had rushed
from their huts and got over the first surprise of our
sudden appearance, they were overcome with joy as I
played on and Pokara sang.</p>

<p class='c009'>I don’t exactly know what happened that night in
Ta-e-mao, though I do know that the high chiefs and
chiefesses treated us both with that punctilious etiquette
always accorded troubadours in those South Sea
mediæval ages. It appeared that we had arrived on the
occasion of a great festival that was being given in
honour of the visit of an aged king from one of the
islands to the south. He was a remarkable-looking
old fellow. He had a face like a gnarled tree-trunk
carved to resemble a man. His teeth were white as
snow. He wore side-whiskers and had a large seashell
tied on to them. He was so stout that, when he went
to drink out of the festival calabash, the royal attendants
laid the receptacle down on the top of his corporation,
then bowed and withdrew. He had brought with him
his two daughters, or granddaughters, I forget which.
They were comely-looking girls. One was even beautiful,
according to our European ideas of that oft-misused
word. Her thick, curly hair was artistically adorned
with orange blossoms, and her attire consisted of a
most attractively woven raiment of tappa-cloth that
fell to her knees. She had fine dark eyes, luminous with
a golden light, and they might well have fired the
imagination of a less bold and outrageous youth than
myself. Though I was not aware of it, Pokara well
knew that she was <i>taboo-bride</i>, which means that she
had just arrived of age, and, being a princess of a certain
grand old dynasty, was entitled to propose to, and
accept, the first high chief of royal blood, or whoever
might please her eyes. In short, my confession is
this: I made gallant advances to her, and she received
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>them with an abandonment that was boundlessly refreshing
and romantic, not only to myself but to the
royal assemblage of high chiefs and the old king also.
One thing will I say in palliation of all that I may have
done, and that is, that I had not the slightest idea
that the delicious cooling drink proffered to Pokara
and myself with immense liberality was an intoxicating
beverage. And I am sure that that drink had a good
deal to do with the heathenish doings of Pokara and
myself and the final episode that night in Ta-e-mao.
Her name was Soovalao, and it is a positive fact that
Soovalao stood before me, lifted one dusky arm, and
sang a heathen bridal <i>himine</i> to my eyes! The applause
at this choice of hers was terrific! It is even possible
that I, in some subconscious way, responded to the
princess’s love-tokens and modest caresses. For I
distinctly recall that I heard the tribal drums crash
forth a mighty <i>fortissimo con passione</i> as I gallantly
accepted the beautifully-carved tortoise-shell comb
from her hair, kissed her hand, and repeated some old
Tahitian rite! But alas! in delicate compassion for
those who would resent this sad confession, I will draw
a veil of forgetfulness over the final heathen dance, when
I played the fiddle and Pokara sang, and it seemed
that a thousand dusky beauties of a phantom forest
seraglio somersaulted beneath the moonlit palms!</p>

<p class='c009'>At daybreak I awoke. Pokara was stirring beside
me.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush, O Papalagi, ’tis well that we fly at once.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fly where?” I said, as I rubbed my eyes and stared.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the old chief looked at me, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“O Papalagi, you did accept the princess’s comb, great
gift from her hair, and the whole tribe have accepted
you as great chief!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Have they?” said I.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>Then, as the dawn’s first bird commenced to sing in
the banyans and the village still slept on, Pokara and I
crept forth from our little pagan hut, and dived noiselessly
into the forest!</p>

<p class='c009'>“What happened? What <i>did you</i> do, O Pokara?”
said I, as we camped by a lagoon that day, ten miles
from that pagan citadel.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You no wanter marry princess this day, and go
way to ’nother island to the south of the setting sun,
and Pokara see you no more?” said Pokara.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Um! so that’s how the wind blows,” I muttered to
myself.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was after the aforesaid experiences that we decided
to return to Papeete, and at once set out on our long
return journey. Pokara would swear terrifically, I
know, in his own tongue, as he dropped his huge sack of
tribal presents and sat on a decayed tree trunk, irritated,
as I climbed the trees in search of birds’ nests.
Somehow the old schoolboy’s instinct of bird-nesting
<i>would</i> come back to me. It would have made any
collector’s eyes shine to see the mighty nests that
I found, and the richly-hued splashed cockatoos’,
parakeets’, and strange tropic birds’ eggs that I discovered.
Most of them were too far advanced in fertilization
to “blow out”; but, still, I secured a few fine
specimens that had hard shells and would not easily
break.</p>

<p class='c009'>One night, just as we had made up our beds of moss
and fern grass by a belt of mangroves, and Pokara was
telling me his old legendary stories, we were both
startled by seeing a strange apparition step out of the
forest. It was a fine moonlight night. Pokara leapt
to his feet as I bravely leapt <i>behind</i> him! At first I
thought it was a heathen god. But I discovered that
the peculiar being was real enough, for It wore ragged
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>side-whiskers, large loose pantaloons held up by a belt,
and a tremendous wide-brimmed hat that had nothing
spiritual-looking about it. It was a derelict sailor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What oh, shipmate!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What oh!” I responded, as the stranger gave a loud
guffaw and roared out:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Damn me blasted whiskers, where ther ’ell you
sprung from?—a wirelin too!” he added, as he stared
down at my fiddle.</p>

<p class='c009'>On hearing all that we chose to tell him, he winked,
and told us that he had knocked the skipper of his ship
down, and had made a bolt from Papeete to save being
placed in irons.</p>

<p class='c009'>He <i>did</i> keep us alive that night, I must admit. He
had a large flask of whisky in his pantaloons and plied
himself from it liberally. And the way he sat by us
that night and sang awful songs was something extraordinary
and thrilling. He seemed to be unable to sleep,
and every time I dozed off he caught me a whack on the
back and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wake up, yer young b——!”</p>

<p class='c009'>At daybreak he informed us that he must make
tracks, as he wanted to slip down to the coast and stow
away on one of the trading schooners that traded
between the Marquesas group and Tahiti. I think
that we were about three days’ slow journey from
Papeete when he left us. The last I saw of him was
when his big boots crashed though the forest scrub,
making the parrots rise and scream above the giant
breadfruit trees, as his herculean figure faded away into
the shadows of the wooded depths. Pokara seemed
mighty glad to see him go! I was sorry. I recall
that we camped by a large lagoon near the shore that
night. It was a glorious starlit sky, and Pokara, who
never wearied of telling me his wondrous stories and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>old legends as we camped by those high sea ways, sat
there by the mountains and told me a very fascinating
legend. I saw his eyes brighten as the tale he told revived
the legendary atmosphere of his youth.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see stars—tips of light up there in sky?” said
he, as I lit my pipe and prepared to listen.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes,” said I, as I looked up at the heavens and
saw, millions of miles beyond his dark, pointing finger,
a small constellation of stars, six in all—two very bright
ones, and the remainder stars of about the fourth magnitude.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You liker know, O Papalagi, who those stars are,
why they get in sky and stop up there?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Indeed I would!” I responded.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the old pagan astronomer sighed deeply, and
proceeded:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tousands and tousands of moons ago, big canoe
come from Isles that am in the setting sun. As big
canoe get near Papeete, the win’ blew and blew. Then
the <i>moani</i> (sea) jump and jump and push canoe on the
reefs; bottom of canoe fall out and sailors all go bottom
of sea! One great chief did try to keep life that belonger
him, and so he not sink for a longer time; but
then he too go bottom. But, though he go to bottom
of ocean, he no die dead. It was then that he look
round bottom of sea and feel much worried; big place,
all ’lone. Then he call out: ‘Me great chief Ora Tua
am here at bottom of sea—where am gods?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“It so did happen that goddess Tarioa, who sat at
her cave door weaving the sunsets, seaweed, and the
hairs of dead women to make mats for gods’ feet, look
suddenly round cave door’s corner and see great chief
Ora Tua lying on floor of ocean. Her eyes did shine,
for he, too, look ’andsome chief as he stood up all
tangled in the sunset. For you must know that the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>sun was sinking just same time as canoe bottom was
knock out on reefs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When goddess Tarioa saw Ora Tua, she put her
hand to eyes and stare longer while to see so nice chief,
chief who had belonger world ’way up ’bove sea floor.
She slowly creep out of cave, and while Ora Tua was
looker ’nother way, she catch hold of his hair and pull
’im outer of the sunset. As he stand before her, his
face and form all shining with golden fire and sunlight
that once shine over this world, she say, ‘Ora Tua,
you are ’andsome chief!’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then Ora Tua look at goddess Tarioa, and answer
nice things ’bout the goddess’s face, and he say, ‘Oh,
who are you, so beautiful under the sea?’ Then no time
am waste between them, they faller in love! Big day
gods and Atua (Thunder-god), the god who open door
to let out kind sun in morning and tattoo sky by night,
peep through crack in that big cave and say, ‘Oh, dear!
Dear me! goddess Tarioa am gone now and kiss that Ora
Tua, a dead chief who am not <i>tapu</i>, but am mortal who
once live up in world by the sea.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was then that big gods all rush out of caves and
run after goddess Tarioa and Ora Tua, so that they may
not kiss again. But so big were their shoulders, all
moving alonger underneath ocean water, that it make
big waves tumble about up on sea beneath the stars;
and so ’nother canoe that was filled with nicer Tahitian
maidens knock on reefs and go to bottom of sea
too!</p>

<p class='c009'>“The gods were so pleased that the dead Tahitian
girls so pretty all stand before them, that they forget
all about wicked goddess Tarioa and chief Ora Tua.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What happened then, Pokara?” said I, as the chief
licked his lips and looked up towards the starlit skies in
deep meditation. And he continued in this wise:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“Well, longer time after Ora Tua kiss goddess, she
had two children same time!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Twins?” said I, as I laughed, and Pokara vouchsafed
a solemn smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The gods of shadowland were terrible angry: they
stamp feet till world shake. It was terrible thing for
goddess Tarioa to give forth in birth two mortal children!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Goddess Tarioa know this much, so she cry and
cry out: ‘O great gods, giver unto me nice sweet milk
for my two <i>strikas</i> (children)!’ for her grief was
mucher, since goddess do have no bosoms.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The gods did all look through the big ocean water
like great faces looking through white man’s image
glass; they looker terrible angry at Tarioa and say:
‘Your babies wanter milk?—why am this?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“And Tarioa did hang her head to her bosomless
bosom, where the little ones did move their mouths and
fingers in much sorrow. For a moment the gods did look
in wonder at the children, then they said: ‘O Tarioa,
since thy children are mortal, they must die!’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then the god who tattoos the skies by night look
out of the great Ink of Night, and say: ‘Is it well, O
great Atua, to kill these children? Are they not of those
who gaze on the great blue ways as my finger, toiling
brightly, tattoos the stars?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so did it happen that one god did pray for
Tarioa and her children. So they no kill Tarioa, but
they run after her and drive her to the far north-west
of big ocean floor till she come to the shores! And then
she did run up into the world of sunlight, and standing
on the shore did say: ‘Oh, how nicer a world!’</p>

<p class='c009'>“As she look up at nice trees all blowing and singing
in win’ and saw above the trees the kind blue sky, she
look so beautiful that <i>kamoka-bird</i> (evening-nightingale)
<span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>fly out of big forest by the sea and sit on her head.
It sang and flutter its wings as its feet get much entangle
in goddess’s hair. Then it hopped down on her shoulder,
and try mucher to poke <i>stalos</i> (fireflies) in babies’
mouths as they cry and cry for milk.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But still they cry and cry. Fireflies no good! Then
Tarioa very sad, so she call out. ‘O god of Rain, Ora,
Tane, Maker-of-flowers and birds and nicer things, I
have sin in thy sight, but now I do offer prayer. I will,
O gods, be as sacrifice to thy altars, and my children shall
worship thee if they do live.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“The great god Tane, hearing her prayer, did walk
out of forest. Seeing so beautiful a goddess before his
eyes, he say: ‘You wanter food, milk for babies?’
Then he put forth his big hand and held babies up on
tip of one finger—and looker much pleased! He then
say: ‘Your children, O goddess of sin, may grow up
beautiful through having so nicer a goddess mother;
they might have light of the great gods, my vassals, in
their hearts.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then as the babies cry, god Tane turn in great
hurry to a palm tree just by. He touch the top, that
was ’gainst sky, with his finger, and lo! out sprang a
bunch of ripe coco-nuts! Then he touch shell and so
make soft holes. And then he place babies’ mouths to
the holes so that they could drink of the nicer sweet milk.
He then turn to goddess Tarioa, and touch her breast,
and her bosoms did grow—not two bosoms, but four.
So did she, being a great goddess and loved by Tane,
have four nipples.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So did goddess Tarioa become mortal. Her children
grew up and did have more children who do ever have a
far-away look in their eyes when they stare towards
the setting sun. For you must know that they are <i>tapu</i>
children, and live on the Isles that are far to the north-west.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>And long, long ago, goddess Tarioa did go ’way
to shadowland that is far up in the sky. And it is up
in the sky that her eyes did stop and still stop as she ever
watches by night over her children.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Saying the foregoing, Pokara pointed up to the constellation
of six stars to the far north-west, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Papalagi, there she is!—those two bright stars are
her eyes and the four pale little stars am her nipples.</p>

<p class='c009'>“So you see, O Papalagi, why all the children of the
islands ’way to north-west are <i>tapu</i> (sacred), for they
are the children of the children who did once drink
tapu-milk from the bosom of the stars.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As Pokara finished, he looked intently up at the
heavens. And as I too looked up and saw the two bright
stars, and the accompanying smaller stars twinkling out
there, far-off in the clear night sky, I understood how
wonderful the universe must have appeared to the old
heathens of many ages ago. I could not laugh over
Pokara’s story, as we sat there by the forest lagoons.
I must confess that I too felt some weird fascination
for his heathen world. And, as the old chief laid his
weary head down on the forest floor and the winds sang
mournfully in the mangroves, I looked up towards the
sky and strangely fancied that I saw the beautiful goddess
Tarioa watching from the night-heavens amongst
the stars, watching over her lost children. Then I laid
my head down on my pillow of gathered moss and tried
to sleep. As I watched the moon slowly climbing the
blue vault of space over the forest height, Pokara’s deep
bass snores broke gently through my meditations. After
a while I gazed on the sleeping chief’s face and fancied
he looked like some tattooed mummy who had lain there
in its scented swathings beside me for possibly a thousand
years. It was at that precise moment that my eyes
spied a bright spot that shone like a vast jewel under
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>the distant ivory nut palms. It was a small forest lagoon
that I had not observed before. I was not as surprised
as one might suppose, when the water stirred and
a shock-head of glistening hair protruded and two sparkling
eyes peered at me. I could hardly believe my own
eyes as the head rose higher and a beautiful form slowly
emerged from the silent depths. She was a goddess-like
creation of wondrous beauty; the glistening waters ran
from her tresses down below her thighs as she gazed
upon me. She was not more than twelve yards away.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The wonders of the South Seas have no end,”
thought I, as with finger to her lips she beckoned to me
and came gliding towards me on tiptoe. I instinctively
understood her meaning. In a moment I obeyed. Jumping
to my feet, I clutched my violin and followed her. I
heard the eerie rustle of her shadowy raiment, as her
feet, pattering like rain on palm-leaves, sped softly
beside me. Then we came to the sea. It was a wild,
solitary spot. Only the tiny whirl of the incoming waves
broke the moonlit stillness that dwelt at the feet of the
mountains which rose like mighty sentinels to the north-west.
Taking me by the hand, she led me out to the edge
of the promontory. As I stood there staring on the
strange greenish hue of the sea-line, I realized that I
was standing on the most solitary point of the earth.
Then, as gracefully as possible, I did exactly as she
bade me—sat down in the large bowl of moonlight she
had mysteriously placed there. And, so seated, I lifted
my violin to my chin and played a weird melody, such
a melody as a troubadour might well play to a beautiful
enchantress. It was all real enough, no dream at all.
I even touched myself. “No mistaking me!” I
mumbled. Then I gazed on the sky, and observed that
the stars swam like goldfish across the midnight blue.
I knew that Pokara still lay fast asleep in the forest
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>shadows, little dreaming of the strange visitant who had
lured me from his side. In some strange way I realized
how envious he would have been, could he have seen
me sitting there in that bowl of moonlight playing my
violin. He, I knew, always <i>would</i> think the magic of
things was wholly on his side and not on mine; and there
I was, being strangely favoured by the gods of the
present reality, whereas Pokara had to dive far back into
a heathen past ere he realized such wonders as I realized
that very night. And still I played on, as the maid
danced in a way that surely none had ever seen before.
It did not seem at all strange when she leaned forward
and sang into my ears the melodious old English ballad
“The Mistletoe Bough”; and while I played a tender
staccato on my violin the waves wailed a wistful obligato
<i>con anima espressione</i>, as they rippled on the moonlit
coral reefs.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly the maid, who had been dancing with her
hands raised, stayed the silent trippings of her feet and
fell on one knee before me. In my finest Hans Andersen
style, I took her hand and listened to her pleading. My
heart beat rapidly, I know, as she said in accents soft
and low:</p>

<p class='c009'>“O pale-faced troubadour from the western seas,
come! Follow me!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fancy this being the end of my wanderings in the
southern seas!” I muttered deep within my soul, as
she knelt there on the promontory’s edge and gazed
into my eyes in a final mute appeal. Then I rose to my
feet. I well knew that many men had risked their all
for the sake of the light of witchery in a woman’s eyes.
Perhaps she observed my hesitation, for, as she gazed
on me, I saw her eyes blink, and, lo! I got one splendid
glimpse of the stars that shone in their liquid depths.
Nor could I help myself, as, standing there, I touched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>her lips with my own thrice before I took the final
plunge. I instinctively placed my violin under my coat
so that it would not get wet. Once more I looked up
at the sky. Then we both dived noiselessly into the
ocean and faded away into the depths of a great silence.</p>

<p class='c009'>I opened my eyes. Pokara was still beside me, fast
asleep. Only the passionate song of the <i>O Le Mao</i>,
high up in the breadfruits just overhead, disturbed the
silence of the forest as I stared up at the stars. Then
in some vague longing I turned over and tried to sleep,
so that I might catch up the thread of that dream
again.</p>

  <h2 id='ch03' class='c007'>CHAPTER III. POKARA’S STORY</h2>
</div>
<p class='c017'>Pokara tells me how the first Idol came to be Worshipped.</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c008'>WHEN I opened my eyes, the morning parrots
were wheeling away in screaming droves over
the slopes. Pokara was already awake and busy cooking
yams for our breakfast on a little fire in the open.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-morning, O mighty Pokara!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Pokara, who loved to be addressed thus, saluted me
in his fascinating theatrical style.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did we travel together under the <i>moani ali</i> (sea)
last night, and watch a beautiful goddess walk the midnight
skies with stars shining in her hair, comrade?”
said I, as a bird flew out of the sunrise, pouring forth
passionate melody in its rapture of the awakening day
over our wide bedroom floor and the sculptural beauty of
our vast, columned portico—the mountain gaps high over
the forest slopes. For answer Pokara said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You taster nicer this, O Music Man of long fiddle-stick!”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was good! Pokara was an estimable cook, as well
as being a good companion. I was a connoisseur in
the derelict companion line. I had travelled across the
bushlands, isles, and seas with melancholy old men who
mumbled in their beards; jolly old men with big red
noses; soppy, anæmic-faced youths; lean, cynical men;
scraggy, long-necked Don-Quixote-like beings; religious
maniacs; atheists with sad eyes; glorious old liars
crammed full of romantic notions; Homeric men who
would have been knighted by kings and loved by princesses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>in another age, but alas! hanged in this new age
where they slept with one eye ever open. I had even
met derelict white women on my travels—some in rags,
delicate lyrics of sorrow that only God knew the truth
about; others, women who wore virgin moustaches and
swore so vilely that the pretty brown maid from Malaboo
hung her modest head as she ran off into the forest to
hide for shame that a woman should swear so! And,
notwithstanding this motley collection who had accompanied
me on my travels, Pokara was no mean second to
the best of them!</p>

<p class='c009'>I recall that we were both tired out when we camped
by the sea that day before travelling on in the cool of
evening. For we were within sound of the native
villages and the outskirts of Papeete. Pokara made
a hasty meal of cooked fish from the lagoons. As we
sat there, the ocean resembled some mighty glass mirror,
so calm was the evening. But at times the water bubbled,
was slightly fretted into feathery foams, as though
something moved beneath the surface.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see that on water out there,” said Pokara,
pointing to the movement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, I do,” said I, wondering what on earth Pokara
could make out of such an ordinary movement of the
ocean.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You know, Papalagi, that mighty gods walk ’bout
under sea?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, yes, I’ve heard so,” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then he continued:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Big god walk under sea. He got big shoulders,
wide as mountains, and in his large head of wonderful
hair he stick white feathers. And, as big god Atua Mara
move along ocean floor, feathers in his hair stick out top
roof of the sea, for he always walk about when <i>matagi</i>
(storm) going to blow.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>Saying this, Pokara became excited, and, true enough,
at the spot where he pointed, the water on the glassy
surface trembled, up poked a feather, as though some
mighty god really strode beneath the sea. Pokara continued:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Atua Mara is great shark-god now; but he once
live on land, like me, like you. He once sit under trees
and sang music to the great god of Light. He only one
on world. No other mans, no womans, he quite ’lone,
all-e-samee, he ’appy god. Sometimes he see other gods
in sky when no clouds hide them. Once when win’ blow,
he looker up in sky and saw great god Papo walking
’cross sky, searching ’mong his bright moons and stars,
for he wanter find gods who had disobey him! Suddenly
his angry eyes did flash out the lightnings; his
voice rumbled the great thunders in mountains, for he
did find Taroa, the god of Jealousy, hiding behind cloud!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Papo, the Master-of-all-gods, hold ’im tight, and
struggle longer time with Taroa. But all-e-samee it was
no good. Papo throw big worlds at Taroa and lift up
ocean in hollow of his hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Taroa fight all-e-time like brave chief. Then he
fall dead, and was so big that one of his dark feet did
stretch right ’cross skies! Still, god Papo throw worlds
and oceans at his dead body, and the waters of oceans,
and the worlds that the victorious god still threw, rolled
down the flanks of the dead god, and down the skies like
big rains. So did worlds fall, and isles come on the
seas, and waters of the seas grow bigger and bigger.”</p>

<p class='c009'>After this digression into the wonders of shadowland,
and the reason that so many isles were scattered across
the seas, and the wherefore of the ocean’s deepness, the
old Tahitian continued:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Atua Mara see great fight ’tween gods, and laugh
much, for he like see god Papo win battles.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>“One day, as Atua Mara sit under breadfruit trees
eating sweet potatoes, taro, and more nicer things, he
feel lonely. He no one speak to. No man, no <i>wahinee</i>
(woman), no children cry or laugh. So he look at sky,
and call out to Papo, the Master-of-all-gods, and say:
‘I, Atua Mara, am lonely. Me want ’nother to sit with
me on this world for all the thousands of moons that I
sit in nice sunlight.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“The Master-of-all-gods hear Atua Mara’s call, and
look out of sky with angry eye, and say: ‘O Atua
Mara, you got all world for yourself, big forest trees,
oceans that sing you when win’s blow, yet you want
more?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Atua Mara look up in sky to where voice came from,
and answered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Yes, trees sing to mees, but their songs, like mees,
sound lonely.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Very well,’ answered god Papo, ‘as you not pleased
with my gifts, I show Atua Mara how to get someone
who will sing you all time!’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Saying this, he told Atua Mara what to do.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That same night Atua Mara go creep into forest
and pull off nice scarlet flower from flamboyant tree.
Then, doing what great god Papo tell him, he cut his
side with sharp shell, and take out little bone from his
body, and wrap the flamboyant flower round it. Then
he go down shore to get lump of soft red clay. This
he shape slowly with his fingers. At last the lump of
clay did begin look like what Atua Mara’s heart desired
and what he dreamed about before he found out that
he felt lonely.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Saying this, Pokara looked up at me and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must know, Papalagi, that when he was finish
and all nicer done and smooth” (here Pokara pointed
to his own frame and ran one finger down his thighs),
<span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>and, continuing, said in a hushed voice, “Atua Mara
had made the clay figure of the first womans!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, now!” said I; and Pokara, observing my
interest, breathed deeply and stroked his chin, then proceeded
in this wise:</p>

<p class='c009'>“When Atua Mara had placed the little bone, which
he had carefully wrap up in the flower, in the side of
the clay figure, he did take the clay womans and stand
it on its feet ’gainst a straight coco-palm stem. Doing
this, he very careful that clay figure’s face was turned
towards big waters of the west, where sun say good-bye
to mountain-tops, before it go down through door of
shadowland. That day, next day, and after days, Atua
Mara did come and kneel before the clay womans which
he had make. He look upon it and dance softly with
joy when he notice that, each time he come, the light of
each sunset had shone plopberly (properly) on clay
figure. The clay get softer, and, where he had make
small holes beneath clay womans’ brow, the eyelids did
begin to sprout dark lashes. As hair grew and grew,
falling down figure’s shoulders, he so pleased that he
run ’bout forest calling out praise to Master-of-all-gods.
One day he come at sunset and touch the clay figure.
His work did look so nicer that he touch it with his lips,
and, Masser, it was quite warm! The lips had turned
like to red coral and were curved like the leaf of the
palm. He notice that the figure’s clay bosom was smooth,
and when he did touch it, it heaved soft, like the moving
of deep, still water when stars are imaged. Once more
he placed his lips to the figure’s mouth. Ah, Masser, that
was the first kiss god-mans ever gave unto womans. It
was then Atua Mara gaze deeply at the clay figure’s face
and kiss where he had made holes, which had swollen
and turned into soft eyelids. He kiss again and yet
again, and the eyelids quivered, and, lo, burst softly apart
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>till they caught and mirrored the light of the setting sun.
So pleased was Atua Mara, that he lift his hands to sky
and no speak—for the eyes commenced to move! It was
then that the clay limbs trembled, the mouth open and
speak, saying: ‘Oh, Atua Mara, who am I, here in the
kind sunlight?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was then, Masser, when first woman spoke, that
the win’s sang a long-away-off song in the breadfruits
of the sacred groves; the shadows did fall over the
mountains, the stars turn pale in the lagoons; and before
the moon crept back into the halls of Poluti, at dawn,
it look back across mountains with big red face; then,
with hand over its eyes for shame, crept back home
through the big door to tell the Master-of-all-gods what
had happened in the great world outside.”</p>

<p class='c009'>On saying this, the Tahitian gazed seriously up into
my face and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, Masser, you must know that Atua Mara had
knelt before his figure of clay and worshipped it! Next
night the great God-of-the-skies did look out from behind
cloud and say aloud, ‘Atua Mara, where art thous?’
The god’s voice did echo and rumble across the mountains
of this world, and then did fade into big silence.
Then the voice did come again with greater anger, and
Atua Mara see big figure move ’bout on misty moonlight
of all the sky as someone tramp ’bout shadowland.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Atua Mara, where art thous?’ came again like big
echo. It was then that Atua Mara, who was half-mortal,
crept out of the thicket of bamboos where he had hid
at the first sound of the angry voice of the sky. He much
’fraid, for he know well what he done! His head did
hang down with much shame, like unto great chief when
he lose big battle. He answer great god like unto this:
‘I am here; what you wanter? Me do nothings, O great
God-of-the-sky!’</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>“Then the great god Papo did answer, ‘I give you
all you wanter; you did ask for nice songs and one mans
to speak to, and now you have gone and make figure
different to my wishes, and worshipped it instead of
worship me! For this great sin, O Atua Mara, I banish
you from happiness of sunlight! You shall move ’bout
under great ocean for ever, and your face be like unto
the big face of the grey shark.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“At hearing what the god did say, poor Atua Mara
creep back ashamed into forest to see womans he had
made. As he did creep out of thicket of bamboos, the
womans did much shriek, for Atua Mara’s face was like
unto the cruel face of a shark. But, because Atua Mara
had made the womans himself and had kissed her as the
God-of-the-sky not wish, she was kind and tender; and,
though Atua Mara look much ugly with ’im face like
shark, she sorry and love ’im still. So they had many
children. Then one stormy night, when gods were
angry, Atua Mara die like all men must die. When he
was dead, his spirit did rush out of his body and run
down into the sea so that he could roam the ocean. And
so did he become the shark-god.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Saying this, Pokara looked at me and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“And so, Papalagi, that is why some childrens of the
isles to the north-west have the cruelty of the shark in
their hearts, for they are the descendants of the clay-womans
that Atua Mara made. And Atua Mara is now
one great jealous god. He ever walk ’bout bottom of
seas trying to catch girls and mans so that he can take
them to his cave and make them, like him, unhappy.”<a id='r3' /><a href='#f3' class='c019'><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f3'>
<p class='c021'><span class='label'><a href='#r3'>3</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Some authorities seem to give different versions of the South
Sea creation legends. One legend says: The islands were originally
a large shark. Another, that the god Atua Mara had temples
wherein the priests made sacrifices to his honour; but, being dissatisfied
with so much worship, he pulled the temples down, threw
them all into the sea, and with the rubbish that they made turned
 them all into islands. Yet another legend: The great god Taroa
was the first god of the skies: he laboured so much over creation
that the sweat falling from his body made all the deep seas.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>As Pokara finished his story the shadows deepened
over the mountains. We heard the voices of the natives
who were fishing in the bay at the foot of the mountains.
Then we scattered the red ashes of our camp-fire,
for we still had a mile to journey ere we entered
Papeete. And as we walked away from that spot we
looked back over our shoulders, and I distinctly observed
the feathers of the shark-god’s hair poking out of the
ocean’s glassy expanse. Pokara sighed; and as the first
stars crept out of the deep velvet skies we faded away
along the shore track, on the last mile of our troubadouring
pilgrimage.</p>

  <h2 id='ch04' class='c007'>CHAPTER IV. I MEET ALOA</h2>
</div>
<p class='c017'>The Hut in the Mountains—A Modern Fairy—The Escape—Love’s
Hospitality—The Stranger from the Infinite
Seas!</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c008'>IN this chapter I will tell a true fairy story that is
directly connected with Pokara’s and my own experiences.
Indeed, I imagine it to be one of the most
realistic fairy-tales that it was my lot to hear and witness
in its most full-blooded stage; I also deem that it will
be interesting, in an educational sense, to students of
modern mythology, since it quaintly distinguishes the
difference between pre-Christian mythology and the materialized
Goddesses and Creation myths of to-day,
through being modified by European influences.</p>

<p class='c009'>About a week after my troubadouring expedition with
Pokara, I sat by the old chief’s side wondering what
new venture his erratic personality would thrust upon
me. My comrade, clad in his finest attire of distinguished
chiefdom, had puckered his brows, and his
eyes had that look about them which plainly told me that
he was about to spring some new surprise upon me.
Suddenly he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Masser, you play nicer moosic, therefore am to be
trusted; I knower that you feel kinder towards good
mans who am in trouble and so no tell what you no tell
and so make troubles!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not I, Pokara, old pal,” I responded, though I felt
I was no apostle of such mighty virtues any more than
was Pokara. Without hesitation the aged Tahitian began
to insinuate by gentle hints that he wished me to go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>off with him to see a dear friend who lived in the mountains
that formed a grand background to the semi-pagan
city, Papeete. Before the screaming coveys of parakeets,
that were bound seaward, had faded on the horizon,
we were off.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a long, hot walk as I tramped by Pokara’s side
and we threaded our way through the deep jungle
growth. I noticed that the old chief often stopped and
looked warily over his shoulder, to see if we were observed
as we crept along the winding tracks which ever
led upward like some “Excelsior” of Nature’s ambitious
loveliness that would climb to scenes of ever-increasing
beauty. Indeed, as we climbed the scenery became perfect:
distant landscapes dotted with waving palms, chestnut,
breadfruit, and strange trees painted with rich
crimson and delicate pigments of Nature’s voluptuous
art, ever coming into fullest view. Far away, visible
between rugged descents and sombre clefts, stretched the
sapphire-blue miles of the Pacific Ocean. Seemingly no
human habitation existed in those rugged leagues of
mountain solitude. Emerging from the thickets of giant
bamboo, we came to a space on a plateau, and there, to
my astonishment, I found myself standing before two
small, yellow bamboo huts. I stared in amazement, and
Pokara rubbed his hands in childish delight at seeing the
wonder my face expressed. I half fancied he had led
up to one of the enchanted homesteads of the fairies that
he had sworn had existed in those mountains in his
youth. Death-like silence prevailed. Even the giant mahogany
trees ceased to sigh to the inblown breath of the
distant seas, as I gazed on the magical scene before me.
Pokara had uttered a weird kind of cry: “Aloa! Aue!”
The spell was broken, for the first hut’s little door was
suddenly opened, and out sprang the prettiest fairy-maid
it has ever been my lot to meet. She stared at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>me in a half-frightened way for a moment, then
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yorana, Monsieur!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I lifted my old helmet hat, then in my embarrassment
dropped my violin-case on her bare toes, and murmured,
“Yorana, Mademoiselle.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The fright went from the maid’s eyes when Pokara
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, he all right; he nicer Englese boy, play moosic,
and kind to Pokara.”</p>

<p class='c009'>On hearing this, the Spanish-Tahitian girl, for such
I discovered she was, looked up at me in a most bewitching
manner, and, smiling, revealed a set of invaluable
pearly teeth. Her bright, far-away-looking eyes
cast a spell over me. In my confusion I dropped my
own and, finding myself staring at her bare, graceful
ankles and knees, I blushed, and once more looked
her straight in the face, as Pokara chuckled like a
child.</p>

<p class='c009'>She was clad in true Tahitian style, but with a subtle
decorous picturesqueness such as a poet, sensitive to the
delicate requirements of his art, might have chosen as
a special attire for her after deep meditation—a meditation
that was essentially needful, as one will soon see.
Bare to about an inch below the knees and again from
the exquisitely shaped throat to half an inch below the
bosom’s topmost curve, her figure was revealed with a
delicacy that enchanted me. She appeared like some half-serious,
half-wicked goddess who would lure, would
tempt her lover, and turn to stone at the first hint of
mortal passion. But she was not a goddess nor a beautifully
chiselled terra-cotta statue. Her eyes blinked to
the buzz of the forest flies. Like tiny flashes of
wriggling lightning in two miniature circles of the midnight
tropic skies, those orbs twinkled as the honey-bee
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>clung to the crown of her forest-like hair. And—alas
for human weakness!—there was that about her which
told one that, for all her delicate loveliness, she was imbued
with the frailty of mortals.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just as I was thanking my lucky stars that my eyes
could dwell on so sweet a sight and yet remain in the
realms of reality, the spell was once again broken. For
the maid called out, “Revy! Awaie! Come!” and at
once, as though he had awaited that call, out of the same
small hut walked a sun-tanned, handsome young Frenchman!
And who was he? I will tell you. The young
Parisian, standing there before me with staring eyes, was
a convict, a fugitive from <i>Ill Nou</i>, the penal settlement
of Noumea. He was hiding there in the mountains, secure
from the lashes of the remorseless <i>surveillants</i>, hiding,
guarded by the tender protection of that beautiful
goddess, who was none other than Pokara’s granddaughter!
It appeared that Pokara’s son, who had been
dead then for years, had married a handsome Spanish
woman whom he had saved from a wrecked schooner
that had gone ashore at Papeete many years ago.</p>

<p class='c009'>Aloa was the one child of this marriage, and she was
the one remaining joy of Pokara’s long-vanished connubial
bliss.</p>

<p class='c009'>Reveire, for so I will call that young Frenchman, had
escaped from the convict settlement by stowing away
on a schooner bound for Papeete. He was evidently unaware
of the schooner’s destination, for Papeete, being
under the French, was about the most dangerous place
he could have come to. Probably this fact made his
hiding-place the more secure. Pokara had met the
escaped man whilst out on one of the schooners, and
had immediately accepted the proffered bribe. And it
was whilst he was hiding in Pokara’s bungalow that his
granddaughter Aloa fell madly in love with the Frenchman,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>and suggested that he should hide with her in the
mountains. It was a blessed union. Reveire was a fine
type of fellow. It was some crime of passion that had
sent him into that dreadful exile. From the young
Frenchman’s lips I heard many tales of horrors that were
perpetrated by the <i>surveillants</i> on the helpless convicts
at <i>Ill Nou</i>, New Caledonia. Some of those tales seemed
incredible; but, alas! Reveire’s manner expressed truth
too well.</p>

<p class='c009'>Many times did I visit that magical homestead of the
mountains. And many times, while on tropical nights
the stars sighed over the mountain trees, Pokara and I
would listen as the exile told us his sorrows, while pretty
Aloa murmured, “Aue! Aue!” stroked her lover’s face,
and kissed his hand, tears coming into her eyes to think
he had suffered so much. As I watched that strange
scene of secret domestic grief and happiness, Pokara
touched me gently on the shoulder and whispered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, Masser, we all good peoples here. For I did
fetch priest, <i>kackerlick</i> (catholic), for my Aloa’s sake,
and he did marry them. He good priest and say nothings,
good man he, because he like God and God like
him!”</p>

<p class='c009'>So spake Pokara, thus giving me this utmost satisfaction
of recording the fact that my goddess had entered
the holy bonds of matrimony according to the
modern mythology of the Christian era.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wail! O wail! O jug! jug! too ee wailo,” came the
plaintive strain of the South Sea nightingale as it serenaded
its mate during the intervals of my violin-playing.
It was no nightingale to Pokara and pretty Aloa; it was
simply a tiny, feathered cavalier, robed in a crimson
[woolly] gown of enchantment, singing to its long-dead
lover, pouring forth passionate melody over old memories
of that time ere the gods disguised it as a bird, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>it was a brave Tahitian chief! Though I had had many
weird, dream-like experiences in my travels on sea and
land, I was greatly impressed by the human note of that
forest drama. And, as I listened and watched, drinking
in each incident like a child at its first pantomime,
the fragrant odours of the dying forest flowers and
mellowing mountain fruits, wafted by the warm zephyrs
over that secret homestead, made the scene seem strangely
dream-like. But it was all real enough for, when I
placed my violin to my chin and played the strains of
the “Marseillaise,” Reveire’s eyes filled with tears over
some memory of his far-off <i>La belle France</i> that he
would never see again. But thanks to the inscrutable
kindness of Providence, a small portion of the wistful
soul of chivalrous France came to him, and all seemed
well in the end. For, ere I bade Pokara good-bye, I
went with him for a last trip up into the mountains to
visit that fairy-like secret homestead. Reveire had quite
forgotten his home-sick sorrows. He was laughing like
a big schoolboy. As for Aloa, she was gazing up into
his face, delight sparkling in her eyes, as in her arms she
held up another little Frenchman who was just one week
old—and who had bravely crossed the Infinite Seas to
keep Reveire company.</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c009'>After losing sight of Pokara, who went on a prolonged
visit to some native friends in a neighbouring isle, I
secured a position as violinist in the Presidency orchestra
at Papeete. But, alas! one night when the sea wind was
moaning in the mountain palms near my wooden homestead,
I again heard the call of the wild, and plunged
into a life of vagabond adventure and madness, as will
be seen in the next chapter.</p>

  <h2 id='ch05' class='c007'>CHAPTER V. FAE FAE</h2>
</div>
<p class='c017'>I meet O’Hara—The Emotional Irish Temperament—The
Tahitian Temperament—O’Hara and I go Pearl-hunting—Tapee,
the Old-time Idol-worshipper.</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_25_0_65 c008'>PONDERING over my experiences of idol-worship
and my further adventures in Tahiti, the incidents
connected with the whole matter seem sufficiently interesting
for me to give the story in detail. Not the least
important part of the matter was the headstrong Irish
youth, my companion; indeed, I might say that he was
the prime mover in the whole business.</p>

<p class='c009'>First, I must say that I can tell the story only by
making the facts appear like the buffooneries of a South
Sea burlesque. Thinking it over, I must admit that my
own cheek upon this particular occasion was enormous
and superb! I can recall no other escapade like it,
except, perhaps, my dangerous adventure with Singa
Lorna, the dancing girl, in the heathen monastery at
Fiji. Though I can claim the dubious honour of having
arrived on the shores of four continents with three
halfpence in my portmanteau and an all-absorbing belief
in the generosity of man, of having been a member of
the crew of an old-time blackbirder, and of having been
thrown among the wildest characters found outside the
realms of fiction, I can recall none who managed to
get my head so near the guillotine as did the wayward
Irishman O’Hara. There was a deal of humour
about O’Hara’s personality; it was the humour of romantic
youth, a pathetic humour that is discernible only
to the practical onlooker, or at the time when the tale is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>old. In saying humour, I do not refer to humour as
defined in the old books of recognized jokes, or the
works of many modern humorists, works which, to me,
are the saddest, driest books in existence; but I mean
the humour suggesting poignant laughter, flickering in
the light of the eyes and rippling on the lips, coming like
visible music on the flushed, emotional countenance—the
poetry of laughter and tears as suggested in a Mallarmé
poem.</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c009'>I had been some three or four weeks in Papeete when
I first met O’Hara, the curly-headed Irishman. I was
in the small beach grog-café near Potuo, having a glass
of lime-juice at the time. By this, I do not wish to
infer that I was, or am, a teetotaller: on cold nights
at sea nothing warms my blood like a nip of rum.
O’Hara introduced himself by giving me a whack on the
back, and then joined with immense gusto in the chorus
of “Killarney,” which I happened to be performing
on my violin. Ah, what a voice he had! mellow and
sweet, it vibrated like the strings of a ’cello in the hands
of a Maestro. And, as he lifted his blue eyes and sang
on, moving his fingers before him as though he played an
imaginary guitar, the Tahitian belles, peeping through
the open bar-door, lifted their dusky arms in sheer
ecstasy as they sighed for “One fond look from those
wild eyes.” One maid placed her hands on her hips
and, putting forth her pearly toe-nailed feet in exquisite
style, danced a graceful Tahitian <i>himine</i>. The old
shellbacks waxed enthusiastic and pulled their whiskers,
as they made critical comments on the dancer’s beauty.
I might say here that these dances were wonderful for
their restraint and artistic movement, quite devoid of
the vulgar limb-movements as exhibited in European
music-halls.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>I attribute the almost menacing glance of those Tahitian
orbs on the Celtic temperament for all that occurred
that night. For my Irish friend overshadowed himself,
became one inch taller, and broadened considerably in
the shoulders, on seeing the impression he had created in
the minds of those dusky maidens. His deplorable wit
brought forth roars of laughter from the assemblage of
shellbacks and half-castes who haunted their presence.
Then he ordered a dozen drinks, pressed four plugs of
ship’s tobacco into my hand, and swore that he would
die for my sake. I returned the compliment, and told
him that I did not wish him to die if he would only consent
to sing “Killarney” once more. It was nearly midnight
when the inevitable argument arose and the shellbacks
and traders took sides. I often wonder how
O’Hara and I escaped suffocation in the dust of the
débris as the empty meat-tubs, the wooden bar-screens,
and a hundred drinking-mugs got inextricably mixed up
in the farewell mêlée and wild, insane farewells when
true comradeship returned, after the fight, and each man
had a last drink and then went his way.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such was my first meeting with O’Hara. But I
sought his company again. It was at our next meeting
that he informed me he knew a native who could tell
us where thousands of pearls were deposited. “Pal,
our fortunes are made! Savvy?” I intimated, by a
conciliatory nod, that I did savvy. I had heard before,
both in Australia and the Islands, of such vast fortunes
in the pearl and nugget line; but I had never found
them! The very next day O’Hara introduced me to a
weird-looking Tahitian chief, who was supposed to know
where the pearls were to be found, providing we gave
him a sufficiently large bribe. This chief (his name was
Tapee), was a most striking-looking old fellow. He was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>tall and finely built, and looked about sixty years of age.
His costume consisted of bits of decorated fibre matting
swathed about his loins. He wore a large, cleverly-twisted
palm-leaf hat. His face?—well, it was a face!
I’ve seen thousands of faces in my travels, but never one
like his. Tapee’s face was the essence of faces; it could
easily have made fifty ordinary ones and still possess
enough character to make one stare back if it passed by
in a crowd. The mouth had been finely curved in days
gone by, but years had withered it, making the lips appear
sardonic. The eyes, once clear as a tropic sky full
of stars, had faded into a dim, far-away look, as though
Tapee saw some wonderful new day beyond the peaks
of death—and stared into the beyond with fright! He
was a full-blooded heathen, worshipped idols, and believed
in dreams and dark omens.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Look at him! What a face!” said O’Hara, as he
nudged Tapee in the ribs, bent forward, and exploded
with laughter! Tapee took O’Hara’s boisterousness in
good part, even as a compliment, then, swallowing his
rum, beckoned us both to follow him down to the beach.
When we stood beneath the breadfruit trees, Tapee peered
about to convince himself that we were unobserved.
The shadows of night were falling across the rugged
mountain slopes behind semi-pagan Papeete city. We
could hear the tinkling of guitars, mandolines, and
zithers coming from the Café Française that stood by
the coco-palms near the main street of Papeete. The
enchantment of fairy-land was destroyed by the cries of
“Vive la France! Sacré!” as sunburnt gendarmes
gazed, as only Frenchmen can gaze, into the lustrous
eyes of the pretty “Belles Tahitians.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You wanter lot moneys, great heap pearls, nice Englesman,
eh?” said Tapee.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>“Oui! oui!” said O’Hara and I in one breath, as we
joyously pronounced that French monosyllable.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, Masser, me knowee where tousands of pearls
are hidder in lagoon near coast.” Saying this, the old
chief looked up artfully and continued: “But you
give me moneys firster—if I taker you there to-mollow?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“How do you know that there are pearls in the lagoon?”
said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>Old Tapee’s under lip trembled like a scolded babe’s.
I had doubted a Tahitian’s veracity!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Me ole mans from heaben times, me knowee ebery
think.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Begorra, pal, it’s a shame,—don’t! Look at that
face! Does it look dishonest?” said O’Hara.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” I said, as I gazed reflectively, then handed
Tapee my last forty francs. This made in all
eighty francs, for O’Hara had given him a like
amount.</p>

<p class='c009'>That same night O’Hara pensioned off for life almost
everyone in Old Ireland. He was sure that Tapee told
the truth about those pearls.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the sun was setting, we met Tapee, as arranged.
“Come on, white mans,” said he, as he toddled off.
Then he intimated that, before he took us round the
coast to the lagoon where the wondrous pearls were, he
must first consult someone. O’Hara and I were in a
fever of excitement as we followed him. It seemed
incredible that in a few hours we should both be wealthy
men, and that the élite of the civilized world would fall
in humble obeisance on their knees before two such
scallawags as we were! But it was no dream. There
stood Tapee before us, real enough, wisdom and truth
inscribed on his tawny wrinkled countenance, as he
said:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>“Waiter here, Massers; me back presently, then
shower you pearls.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, we’ll wait,” we replied, as, with a chuckle in
his dusky throat, old Tapee toddled away beneath the
palms. We saw him fade away amid the orange groves.
O’Hara and I looked at each other.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s he up to?” said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a lonely spot. To the right rose the mountains,
and below us, far away, heaved the ocean, as sleepy
winds stirred the forest trees overhead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let’s follow him!” said O’Hara.</p>

<p class='c009'>Without discussion or hesitation we crept under the
coco-palms after Tapee.</p>

<p class='c009'>It seemed as though we had, in some mysterious way,
left the civilized world, and with one footstep walked
across a thousand years into the dark ages. Tapee stood
before us, in a space in the forest, waving his thin arms
and chanting into the lapping wooden ears of a monstrous
idol! Though the old native was six feet in height, he
appeared diminutive as he stood in front of that dilapidated
wooden image. Its big, goggling, glass eyes
seemed to stare right over Tapee’s head, gazing mockingly
at us! We instinctively held our breath as we
stood there exposed to view, for so real did the eyes
look that we fancied that It had observed us. Then we
dodged back into the shadows, for Tapee had started
careering about in the frantic capers of some heathen
rite.</p>

<p class='c009'>“He’s a heathen idol-worshipper!” whispered my
comrade.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then we received another surprise, for out of the
shadows, just by us, in response to Tapee’s weird cry
of “Awaie! Awaie!” sprang what appeared to be a
Tahitian fairy figure! It was a native girl. She was
dressed up in some old heathen-time costume. Her mass
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>of hair was of bronze-gold colour, and fell down in
luxuriant waves which streamed over her neck and
shoulders in attractive contrast to the bright sun-varnished
hue of her smooth skin. Her tresses were
thickly adorned with flowers, and she wore a barbarian
kind of raiment, the tasseled folds of which reached
down to her knees. (It was a style similar to that which
I had seen worn at the tribal festivals in New Guinea
and the Solomon Isles). In a moment she too was
careering round the idol in company with old Tapee, as
she chanted a <i>himine</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O Loa!” whispered Tapee, as he turned about and
stared into the forest shadows, as though he wondered
if we were near enough to hear the girl’s loud singing.
O’Hara moved forward.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Keep out of sight; let us see it all,” I whispered,
in at the same time pulling him back by the coat-tail
into the shadows. Tapee had commenced to dance again.
Then the girl fell on her knees before the big image,
and began to beat her body with her hands in a heathen-like
manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>To my sorrow Tapee suddenly turned round and observed
us peeping from the bamboo thicket. He looked
frightened out of his life.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Masser, you no tell Flenchmans that me worship
idols? Me know where pearls are, and ’tis this nicer
idol who tell Tapee where pearls are found.”</p>

<p class='c009'>My comrade only stared, hardly knowing what the old
native was driving at, till he continued:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I come here to ask this idol where pearls are, now
I am awake. You know, Masser, that I only dream of
pearls first; idol tell all ’bout after—savvy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Thinking of my money, I shouted, and somewhat
fiercely I think, “Don’t you know where the pearls are,
you old scoundrel? What about the eighty francs we’ve
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>given you?” I added, as Tapee hung his head, and then
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Me get Fae Fae, who am witch-girl, to ask idol
where the pearls are, and if idol no tell her, well, me give
you back your moneys!”</p>

<p class='c009'>It all ended in Tapee falling on his knees and saying:
“Oh, Masser, me and Fae Fae be put in calaboose if you
tell of us. Me great chief and Fae Fae is great princess,
same blood as Queen Pomare.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So spake Tapee, as he pointed to the girl, who stood
trembling and abashed beside him. After that the old
chief took us into his confidence, and we found, from
what he told us as we stood there, that he too was related
to the Queen and that Fae Fae was his niece. It
appeared that he had managed to get her under his influence,
and so she often came out of the palace across
the valley, to join Tapee in his heathen worship. For
a long time the old man wailed into our ears. Then we
gathered that Fae Fae was engaged to be married to a
high chief named Tautoa, and that Tapee was very much
afraid of this chief.</p>

<p class='c009'>All that seemed to concern my Irish comrade was
Fae Fae and her fright. O’Hara’s manner became quite
tender as he repeatedly assured her that we should never
say a word to anyone about what we had seen. At this
Fae Fae gave O’Hara a languishing glance, and seemed
to look with great favour upon him, notwithstanding that
she was engaged to be married to the high chief Tautoa
whom Tapee had just told us about.</p>

<p class='c009'>In the end we helped Tapee to drag his huge idol into
the deeper undergrowth and so hide it securely from
prying eyes. The old chap was so overcome by our
friendly manner that he volunteered to refund us part
of our money. Indeed, I think we got it all back, less
thirty-five francs, which Tapee had spent in the fan-tan
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>bar-room at the Chinese quarter at Soloam, Papeete.</p>

<p class='c009'>So ended our adventure as far as the pearls were concerned;
but it led to another very exciting one, as will
be seen in the next chapter.</p>

</div>
<p class='c017'>O’Hara in Love—Fae Fae’s Midnight Elopement—Chased—A
Melodramatic Race for Life—The Innocence
of Eve—Temptation—The Lost Bride—The Madness of
Romance—Outbound for Honolulu.</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c008'>I&nbsp;HAD just returned from an engagement where I had
performed violin solos at the French Presidency concert,
when I met O’Hara again. I was sitting in the
wooden café at Selao at the time.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, what’s the matter now?” I said, as O’Hara
greeted me. I noticed that he looked rather mournful.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pal, I’m not going to be done; I’ve made up my
mind to marry the girl Fae Fae, and be damned to her
old nigger chief, Tautoa!”</p>

<p class='c009'>One can imagine my astonishment as O’Hara blurted
out the foregoing, for I had no knowledge whatever that
he had seen Fae Fae since we had first seen the girl
dancing round an idol in the forest. Slowly the truth
came out. It appeared that O’Hara had been secretly
meeting Fae Fae every night since the idol adventure.
Things had come to such a pass that Fae Fae had agreed
to bolt from the palace and marry him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the trouble, then? Don’t you want to marry
her?” said I, as O’Hara finished a glowing account of
Fae Fae’s affection for him.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then O’Hara made a further confession. It appeared
that, in his usual careless way, he had been overbold,
and so had spoiled his chance of wooing Fae Fae on the
sly. He had gone to the Queen’s palace one night, and
had serenaded Fae Fae on the guitar, like some old-time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>Spanish cavalier. This mad act had got Fae Fae
into trouble, for she, in her impulsive way, had rushed
from the palace stockade gate straight into O’Hara’s
arms. It so happened that Tautoa, the chief to whom
Fae Fae was betrothed, caught them in each other’s arms!
And my chum had made matters worse, for he had
managed to give Tautoa a black eye in the mêlée that
followed his mad presumption. It appeared that Fae Fae
was now under strict surveillance. And, more, the head
chiefs had laid a charge at the Government Presidency
about the matter. And I believe that, even at that early
date, a warrant was out for the arrest of O’Hara for
disturbing the peace and forcing his presence on a native
maid of royal blood. When O’Hara first unfolded his
plans for abducting Fae Fae, I endeavoured to reason
with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s ridiculous, pal. You’re talking like a South
Sea novel. You can’t seize a beautiful girl of royal
blood, a princess, and carry her away from the palace
like some old freebooter of the southern seas. Besides,
we’ll be arrested by the gendarmes. And there’s the
old Queen to be considered, her consort, her son, and,
last and not least, Fae Fae’s legitimate lover, Tautoa.”</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Hara used a quite unprintable word as I mentioned
that last name. Then he stared as though I were mad,
and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Me! talking like a novel! I mean to have her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>His eyes flashed as he blurted out his plans, telling
me how easy it was to steal a girl and bolt off into
the mountains! His chest swelled visibly over his
thoughts. Holding up his glass of vile Papeete beer
in one hand, melodramatic fashion, he lifted his chin
and burst into some Irish song that told of maids clasped
in the arms of impassioned lovers. As he finished his
extemporization, the native girls who were standing at
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>the shanty’s door, murmured, “Yorana! Yorana!”
One dusky Tahitian belle, with large, lustrous eyes,
crossed her bare, smooth arms and one timid knee, and,
as she leaned against the door frame, gave a delicious
pout, telling with admiring eyes all that a romantic maid
can tell when gazing on a man whose favour she yearns
to gain.</p>

<p class='c009'>Though I had sought by wordy wisdom to persuade
O’Hara to abandon his mad idea of abducting Fae Fae
from Pomare’s palace, my heart was as enthusiastic
about it all as was his own. The philosophy of the
first fine careless rapture of youth was mine. I felt I
was out in the world to live, if somewhat faintly, some
of the glorious romance that poets wrote about. I well
knew that the great crabbed philosophies were written
by perished feathered quills on musty parchments, quills
that once fluttered on living wings among the blossoming
boughs. I knew that no pen, however inspired, could
sing the impassioned philosophy of life as the throbbing
red throat of the brown thrush can sing, or as O’Hara
and I could live it. And, so, I must confess that the
idea of the breadfruit sighing as we sat awaiting the
sunset’s close and O’Hara impatiently watching for the
favourable moment to abduct a Tahitian princess from
a pagan palace on a South Sea isle, seemed the perfect
music and the most noble endeavour of the Psalm of
Life!</p>

<p class='c009'>For several moments I compressed my brows as
though in deepest meditation over the wisdom or folly
of doing what O’Hara proposed.</p>

<p class='c009'>He watched me closely, then suddenly gripped my
hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pal, I’m with you; it shall be done,” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>My Irish comrade was satisfied. He knew me. I
hadn’t stowed away on sailing and tramp ships, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>lived with rats in coal bunkers on long voyages across
tropic seas, without looking a bit determined when I
had really made up my mind—well—to make a fool of
myself!</p>

<p class='c009'>I knew that Queen Pomare of Tahiti was allowed a
certain amount of authority over her people. Though
aged, she was an attractive, powerful-looking woman.
It was also hinted by the officials that she still leaned
towards her old creed. However that may have been,
her retinue was made up of many old-time, ex-cannibal
chiefs. One had only to go by night up the mountain
slopes by Tamao to hear the low chanting of festival
sounds coming from the solitary palace, sounds that
were suspiciously like the wild night-wassailing of some
frenzied heathenland!</p>

<p class='c009'>The very next night we made our plans. O’Hara
smacked me on the back, and called down the blessings
of the Virgin on my head for helping a pal in trouble.
It was finally settled that we should set out on our romantic,
risky adventure after dusk, the very next day.</p>

<p class='c009'>The inevitable hour arrived. I stood beneath the palms
at the arranged spot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you ready, pal?” said O’Hara, as he met me.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am!” said I; and then added: “I suppose you
are determined to attempt to abduct Fae Fae?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“By the holy Virgin, yes!” he muttered.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can rely upon you that the maid knows of your
intentions, and has agreed to bolt off into the mountains
with you?” said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Hara gave a scornful laugh. It was then he told
me that old Tapee had slipped, under the cover of night,
into the palace, and had bribed one of the sentinels to
deliver his <i>billet-doux</i> into Fae Fae’s hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ho! so that’s how you’ve managed it all, is it?”
I answered.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>I felt much relief; for I will admit that I knew O’Hara
well enough to realize that he was likely to go off and
seize a maid who knew nothing of his coming. At
hearing that old Tapee was in the secret, I felt cheered
up, and had greater faith in the result of the expedition.
So off I went, down the forest track with O’Hara, on
the wildest adventure into which I have ever plunged.
We crept across the lonely Broome Road, and passed
under the shades of the giant breadfruit trees. The
stars were shining. Hardly a breath of wind disturbed
the leaves of the mountain palms. O’Hara clutched
me by the arms, as though he were afraid I might change
my mind—and make a bolt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m game; don’t worry. I’ll see you through,” said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Faith and be shure, you’re a good pal,” said my
adventurous, amorous comrade.</p>

<p class='c009'>Taking a large flask from his pocket, he handed it to
me. Though not an imbiber of proof spirit, I took rather
a bold nip, feeling that a little extra Dutch courage might
not be amiss ere the night was out! We had arrived
at the outskirts of the large cultivated space that half
surrounded Queen Pomare’s palace stockade. As we
passed through the arcades, constructed by Nature’s
brooding handiwork of interlacing branches of tropical
undergrowth twining round the first pillars of giant
trees, my heart fluttered slightly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it some mad dream?” I thought, as we stood
on the little moonlit slope that faced the palatial stockade
of Pomare’s dwelling. Standing there, by O’Hara’s
side, I peeped down the palm-terraced groves and spotted
the large one-storied, verandahed building. It had an
ominous look about it. Then O’Hara took me up a
track where I had never been before.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Keep in the shadows; don’t expose yourself, for
God’s sake!” he whispered, as we stole onward.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>We arrived among the thickets of dense bamboos
growing by the wooden gate that was the side entrance
to the palace. We stood perfectly still and waited.
O’Hara gave a low whistle. Our hearts beat like muffled
drums as we stood there. I looked at the dim outline
of the palace. All was silent, phantom-like, in the
rising moonlight. Only one small light flickered in the
little latticed window-hole by the main entrance.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s that light?” quoth I in a hushed voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s where the Queen sleeps,” replied my pal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it really?” I whispered, as I thought in some
mad way of the old romantic novels that I had read in
my schooldays.</p>

<p class='c009'>Yes, and there was I, sure enough, with a mad Irishman,
outside a barbarian’s palace, awaiting the psychological
moment to seize a heathen princess!</p>

<p class='c009'>We must have stood there for half an hour before
O’Hara gave the fourth whistle and said, “She’s being
watched, that’s what it is; otherwise, begorra, she’d
have come out of that gate before now.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“What shall we do now?” said I, feeling fit for any
emergency as the spirit commenced to take effect. The
romance of the whole situation began to bubble, to thrill
in my soul. Indeed, I had become as enthusiastic as
O’Hara over the prospective elopement of Fae Fae.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Old pal,” said he, “I’m going into the palace to
seize her; that’s what I’m going to do!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good Lord, really!” said I, as visions arose of
dramatic scenes that might ensue when we got into that
eerie-looking, big wooden building.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Won’t they hear us—and club us?” said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Not they! I’ve been in the palace before by night;
I know where Fae Fae sleeps, and it’s no hard job to
find her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You do, do you!” thought I. Then O’Hara began
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>to creep down the orange grove and, like some obsequious
shadow, I followed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Not a sound broke the primeval stillness as we curved
round the small track that led to the main entrance of
the palace. At that very moment a night bird, somewhere
up in the mangroves, burst into song. It gave
a sharp scream as we passed like shadows beneath the
trees, and then flapped away. We both leapt back into
the deeper gloom. Our hearts nearly stopped, for lo!
the bushy head of some high chief suddenly poked out
of the half-open gate at the main entrance. We watched
that big mop-head and fierce-looking face turn to the
right and left, peer into the moonlight a moment, then
we saw it withdrawn from view.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’d like to give that cove one on his napper!” whispered
O’Hara, with a levity which I thought considerably
out of place at such a time. “I know him; it’s old
thin-legs, the night sentinel. I’ve tried to bribe the old
wretch, but ’twasn’t any go.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh!” said I, for the want of saying something better
at such a moment. Indeed, the most poignant phrases
that the English language can twist together could not
have expressed all that I felt.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What do you intend doing now?” said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, I’m going to slip into the palace and see Fae
Fae in her private chamber. She’ll soon come when
she sees us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you sure she won’t scream? Don’t you think
it’s a bit unwise, in the night-time, like this?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Blimey ducks, no!” chuckled O’Hara. Thereupon
I made up my mind to seize the blessed Queen herself,
if O’Hara wished me to do so.</p>

<p class='c009'>To tell the truth, I had wondered if Fae Fae would
not take fright at seeing me with O’Hara. It appeared
that my comrade had wooed Fae Fae considerably in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>the little time he had known her. But I had only seen
her twice—and there I was, bound for her sleeping-apartment
in the dead of night.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once again we moved on. Arriving before a little
door that led into a roomy apartment adjoining the west
wing of the palace, O’Hara gently pulled another door
open. We both crept in. It was nearly pitch dark; the
faint rays of moonlight, peeping through chinks in the
roof, just helped us to grope along. As we moved
stealthily across the floor, I stumbled over a large calabash.
We stood still, breathless with suspense. I looked
around: on the walls, dimly revealed by the moonlight,
hung old war-clubs, spears, and other ancient heirlooms
of the Pomarean dynasty. We heard a door open, then
it was shut again, for the sounds of distant laughter and
heathen voices swiftly ceased. It came from somewhere
on the other side of the courtyard, that portion of the
palace where Queen Pomare and her suite dwelt. Once
more we crept on. Passing across another room, we
suddenly came out into a small courtyard.</p>

<p class='c009'>Turning to me, O’Hara whispered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You see that door over there, on the far side of
that wooden building? Well, it opens into a long corridor,
and at the far end is the chamber where Fae Fae
sleeps.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I nodded.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you game to follow me, pal?” he added.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am!” said I, as I clutched my revolver and thought
how “gamey” we might both soon be if we were discovered.</p>

<p class='c009'>I don’t know if my story sounds like a sketch from
some semi-comic opera, but I <i>do</i> know that it was a serious
thing for us to attempt to get into a native girl’s
bedroom as we did that night. But, mind you, I believed
implicitly in O’Hara’s good intentions. Never once had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>I observed him take a liberty with a maid. He had the
Celtic temperament, but was clean-minded, notwithstanding
his sins. We opened the door that led down the corridor
to Fae Fae’s bed-chamber; then we took a rather
bold nip at the flask of whisky. In complete obedience
to O’Hara’s whispered directions, I at once went down
on my knees, then, hand over hand and knee over knee,
we began to travel down that dark, narrow corridor!
A stream of moonlight crept through the airholes that
were in the roof. I could just discern O’Hara’s ragged
coat-tails in front of me as I blindly groped along behind
him. I saw the dim shadows of the palms waving
about, silhouetted on the wooden walls as the winds
stirred the forest trees outside. Arriving about half-way
down the corridor, I whispered to my comrade:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Supposing she’s asleep? Do you intend to seize
her whilst she lies in bed? Won’t she scream if she
sees me with you, and awaken the whole palace?”</p>

<p class='c009'>I knew what English girls would do if they suddenly
awoke and saw two sunburnt tramps on their knees,
peering round the edge of their bedroom door at the
dead of night.</p>

<p class='c009'>My relief was considerable when O’Hara whispered:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t worry; Fae Fae expects me, and it’s not her
who is going to scream.” Then, in a tense whisper, he
added: “Besides, she sleeps alone, away from the rest
of the palace folk.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thank God for that much!” thought I, as we once
more started to creep, like two monstrous slugs, down
the floor of the corridor.</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Hara suddenly stopped. My heart gave a slight
flutter. I knew we had arrived outside Fae Fae’s chamber.
I heard my comrade give two soft taps—so, “tap!”
“tap!”—on the door’s bamboo panel with his knuckles.
Each tap seemed to echo and re-echo down the silent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>corridor. I was thankful that I had drunk deeply from
the whisky-flask which O’Hara had so thoughtfully
handed me. Had we been about to seize a heathen man,
or even an old woman, the matter would have seemed
different. Notwithstanding that I had knocked about
the world, the thought of so rudely disturbing a maiden’s
slumber and those romantic ideals which I can find no
name for here, had still a great influence over me. Consequently,
I paused on the threshold of that chamber.
She was an innocent girl, none need doubt that much.
To the reader, who has never plunged into such a midnight
venture as I tell of here, I can confidently say
that he would require a little artificial stimulant to buck
his courage up were he placed under like circumstances.
There’s something eerie in creeping into a semi-heathen
palace and crawling down an interminable corridor to
seize a maid as she sleeps in her chamber. And all this,
mind you, not for one’s self, but for another! And,
again, there was not only the danger of detection by
that heathen crew to reckon with, but also the French
officials, who would assuredly give us penal servitude in
the <i>calaboose</i> (jail), or transport us to Noumea should
they catch us on this mad venture. But for the fact
that we had youth’s superabundant confidence on our
side, I am sure we should never have ventured on such
an escapade. I recall the breathless hush of that supreme
moment when O’Hara once more gently tapped
the maiden’s door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fae Fae!” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c009'>How eagerly we listened! Only a faint moan came
from the forest palms just outside, then all was silent
again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Begorra, she’s not there,” came in an agonized whisper
from O’Hara.</p>

<p class='c009'>Our hearts thumped—we heard a rustling sound, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>resembled a noise made by someone yawning. An uncomfortable
suspicion flashed through my brain: Had
O’Hara mistaken the room? and was that chamber occupied
by some mighty chief?</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s that?” I said in a tense whisper, as that
eerie sound came again, with the soft patter of bare
feet. “Look out, pal!” I whispered, instinctively ducking
my head in some vague idea that a club was falling
on it!</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Hara tapped again, then softly called the maid’s
name. I looked up, my heart in my mouth, as we
crouched there, both on our hands and knees. The
door creaked. We watched—and it was being slowly
opened. Through a chink, that was no wider than two
inches, peeped two sparkling eyes, half hidden by dishevelled
tresses—it was Fae Fae!</p>

<p class='c009'>In a swift, hoarse whisper O’Hara said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s only us, Faey.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At once the door opened a little wider, and two astonished
eyes looked down upon us, both there on our
hands and knees!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Messieurs, you be killed!” she whispered, as
she lifted her hands and gazed upon us in an awestruck
manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>Slinking there, behind O’Hara’s coat-tails, I gazed up
at the maid through his armpits!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Didn’t you hear me whistle, Faey dearest?” said
my comrade, as the astonished girl still stared at us in
fright.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, Monsieur Hara, I sleep fast,” she said, rubbing
her sleepy eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this candid confession, O’Hara looked crestfallen.
I, too, must confess that a dash of cold water seemed
to have been thrown upon the fires of my romantic soul.
I pinched my leg to convince myself that I was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>dreaming. It was real enough, no dream at all. It
was a solid me intruding into a girl’s bed-chamber at
the dead of night, ready to clutch the maid and help
my comrade to carry her away into the mountains!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, Fae Fae, don’t go back on me, darlint,” wailed
O’Hara, as the pretty maid looked about in a bewildered
way, as though hesitating as to what she ought to
do under such distressing circumstances.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this moment I poked my head up from behind
O’Hara and revealed my physiognomy clearly in the
shifting moonlight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oui! oui! Awaie!” she woefully ejaculated, as she
recognized my impertinent presence. Then she peered
again, and said: “Tre bon! it’s nicer fiddle man!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I rose to my feet as though I had just received a knighthood,
and bowed with such courtesy as I felt was due
at such a moment. I may have blushed, but I do know
that my heart warmed considerably to the possibilities
of the whole business. Much of the girl’s apprehension
seemed to have vanished at discovering that it was I
who had accompanied O’Hara on my hands and knees
down that damned corridor! Ah me! As she stood
there bathed in moonlight, her tiny blue chemise ornamented
with flowers, I quite envied O’Hara. The hibiscus
blossoms in her mass of rich-hued hair were crushed
on that side where her pillowed head had lain but a moment
before in sleep. I felt the thrill of her presence.
Standing there in the gloom, I saw O’Hara put forth
his arms towards Fae Fae.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on, Faey,” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Leaning forward in the gloom, Fae Fae misjudged
the distance, and placed her mouth on my flushed cheek.
Then it really seemed that the tender pressures of our
groping hands got inextricably mixed up. I became
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>bolder. Looking into the girl’s face, I said in an appealing
way:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, Fae Fae, <i>do</i> come!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I felt that, to creep into a heathen’s palace to help a
maid to elope, and for the maid to refuse to come, would
cast a slur on my idea of chivalry and romance such as
I could never forget. I was immensely relieved when
I noticed Fae Fae stoop and start shuffling about her
chamber floor. She was hastily gathering together her
spare clothing!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Awaie! Messieurs!” she cried softly. Then she
held up a small bundle, and blushed through the brightness
of her eyes. Gallantly I leaned forward and clutched
those delicate garments that made up Fae Fae’s trousseau!
As for O’Hara, he grinned and then stared in
surprise, as he observed my correct manner when I
bowed and offered Fae Fae my arm. (He hadn’t read
Alexandre Dumas, Byron, Shelley, and Keats, and slept
with his dreaming head on a volume of <i>Don Quixote</i>.)</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly a door banged somewhere across the palace
courtyard; we distinctly heard distant sounds of laughter
and indistinct voices. Then silence came; the door had
been closed again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on, there’s no time to lose,” I whispered, as
I clutched the pretty sandals that Fae Fae hurriedly
picked up from beneath her bamboo couch. Down the
corridor we crept. As Fae Fae caught hold of my hand
I returned the gentle pressures of that frightened Tahitian
maid. I gathered that she did not realize the seriousness
of the business. As we stole along, a puff of wind
came down the narrow corridor, and her mass of unkempt
hair floated softly against my face. I felt as
though some beautiful creation of romance had materialized
before my eyes, as a silken tress touched my lips.
Only O’Hara’s heavy breathing, as he led the way, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>Fae Fae’s frightened gasps, made me realize that the
whole business was real enough. We all gave a deep sigh
of relief as we stole out into the night. A mighty alarm
had seemed to thunder down the silence of that palace
corridor. Then O’Hara informed me that he had missed
the track whereby we had entered the palace. It was
unfortunate, for it necessitated our all climbing over a
huge wooden wall that ran along the south side of the
track that led to the entrance of the palace stockade.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come along, Fae Fae,” said I cheerfully, as the cool
air of the moonlit night and the glory of physical movement
raised my spirits. O’Hara clambered up to the
top of the wall first; releasing Fae Fae’s trembling hand,
I followed. It was not hard climbing, for the huge,
upright logs were thickly overgrown with tough vine.
“Look out!” said I, as I stood in that elevated position
and nearly stumbled. Squatting side by side up
there, we looked down. Fae Fae stared up at us; she
was half hidden in the forest ferns. O’Hara and I
clasped each other’s hand to get a better grip, then, bending
down, we very carefully gripped hold of Fae Fae’s
extended hands and slowly hauled her up to the top of
the wall.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Messieurs, it’s tellible!” murmured the frightened
girl as she stood high up there beside us. She
shivered as she put forth her arms in fright to retain
her balance. Her tiny, blue diaphanous robe was out-blown
as the night wind sighed across the forest height.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t be frightened, Miss Faey,” I murmured, as
the girl swayed in terror, pressed my hand, and looked
appealingly into my eyes as we stood up there.</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Hara and I gripped her carefully by the arms,
swayed her to and fro in space for a second, then dropped
her softly down into the mossy growth and fern of the
forest on the other side of the wall.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“Awaie!” she cried, as she looked up at us.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then my comrade and I slid gently down, like threaded
spiders, into the mossy scrub.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment we stood breathless, as Fae Fae clung
to our arms, trembling in fear. To the right lay the
main track; once across that, we could bolt into the
forest depth, where we would be safe. I awaited
O’Hara’s signal. I was taking no risks. O’Hara knew
the place too.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly my comrade said, “Now!” and off we went,
rushing like three phantoms across the exposed moonlit
track.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Holy St. Patrick!” breathed my chum, as we stood
behind the thick clump of bananas that divided us from
the twelve yards that we must yet pass ere we were out
of sight of the main entrance to the palace.</p>

<p class='c009'>We were suddenly paralyzed by hearing a terrific yell.
We had been observed! That yell smashed to atoms
all my indecision as to what was best to do. Metaphorically
speaking, it arrayed me in armour, equipped me
with all the necessary weapons to fight a desperate battle
for life and for the protection of the trembling girl beside
me.</p>

<p class='c009'>I looked down the track: out of the main entrance
had rushed three stalwart Tahitian chiefs. They were
quivering with excitement. We remained standing still.
I felt strangely calm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re in for it now,” said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Hara shook his fist and picked up a large stone.
A glorious feeling of exultation thrilled me at the
thought of the coming race for life. It was just in my
line, whereas creeping on my hands and knees down a
corridor was dead against the grain.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fae Fae gave a faint cry. It roused us. Simultaneously
we dashed away into the depths of the breadfruits
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>and coco-palms. What a sight!—Fae Fae, bare-footed,
encumbered only by her pretty native <i>mumu</i>
(chemise) of scanty width, raced ahead, as O’Hara and
I, our arms held high in racing attitude, puffed on
behind!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Follow her, pal; she knows the way,” murmured
O’Hara, as Fae Fae’s dusky flying heels glittered in
the moonlight about twelve yards ahead of us! Though
I admired that impulsive Irish comrade of mine, I inwardly
thought what an ass he was; for, though our
pursuers were hard on our heels, I distinctly heard him
chuckling to himself, making ecstatic remarks about
Fae Fae’s swaying figure as she fled down the forest
track! I turned my head to see how it went with the
enemy. I was extremely disconcerted at observing them
coming up over the ridge of the rising ground, quite distinct
in the brilliant moonlight. A giant of a fellow
was gaining ground, was far ahead of the other pursuers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wait!” I shouted in O’Hara’s ear. “We must
frighten them somehow.” I knew, well enough, that
we were in the wrong, that we could be legally charged
with a serious, very serious offence. I felt some sad,
prophetic pain of a club falling on my romantic skull
and my head tumbling into the official guillotine basket.
This sudden visualizing freak of my imagination was
made the more vivid through my seeing Fae Fae racing
along the track like some frightened child (she was
little more than a child in mind), as I lumbered on
behind her, clutching her delicate trousseau under my
arm. Indeed I felt the guiltiest of the three. Fae Fae
was a child of the forest; O’Hara was another child,
since he was madly in love; while I?—well, instead of
giving wise counsel, I was there, an accessory before
and after the fact, and with the maid’s scanty wardrobe
under my arm! Preposterous!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>“Go on; never mind me,” said I, when O’Hara
suddenly stopped dead short. There, on the track, I
held up my revolver and fired over the head of the
mop-headed savage who was a hundred yards ahead
of the others. They slowed down. I saw the leader
wave his hand, and heard him yell out some words in
his native lingo, something that ended with the words
“Fae Fae!”</p>

<p class='c009'>On hearing that name, O’Hara gasped out:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, it’s him, that damned Tautoa, who wants to
marry my Faey!”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was with immense relief that I noticed that the
pursuers had slowed down and were apparently frightened
at discovering that I was armed. We couldn’t outrun
Fae Fae. O’Hara and I had all we could do to
catch up to her as she still raced on, speeding round the
curves of the forest track. Indeed at times we could
not see her at all, knowing that she preceded us only
because of the tiny, smoke-like clouds of dust that we
raced through, the diamond-like powder that her bare,
flying feet stirred and left behind as she raced along the
track. Sometimes the path wound into the full light of
the moon; it was then that we sighted Fae Fae’s flying
figure and floating hair as we thundered along behind
her. I am sure the scene must have looked like some
burlesque or the rehearsal for a cinematograph picture.
As we passed the deep lagoons by the shore, weird
shadows whipped across the imaged, broken moons that
were shining in the still, glassy depths! For, as the fireflies
danced in the leafy bamboo glooms, I saw Fae Fae’s
image, with flying hair, race across the lagoon’s surface
to the right of us, though she, herself, had passed round
the bend and was quite out of sight! To the southward
stretched, for miles and miles, the palm-clad slopes. It
seemed as if we were racing across a vast landscape oilpainting!
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>To the north-west rose the pinnacled range
of <i>La Diadème</i>. We had reached the Broome Road.
As we raced across it we just missed a crowd of hurrying
Chinamen who worked in the cool of night in the
plantations of vanilla, coffee, sugar-cane, and orange
groves.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hon kong ching chi chow kow!” yelled a straggler,
as his pig-tail tossed up, and he fell sprawling in the
dust.</p>

<p class='c009'>“One for his napper!” breathed O’Hara, as he recovered
his balance and we rushed across the plantation.
We were safe! There stood Tapee’s bungalow to the
left of us. All would have gone well had not O’Hara
stumbled as he leapt across the stream. He gave a yell
of pain, and fell crash on his face.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fae Fae gave a cry. Then she and I, breathing heavily,
picked our comrade up. He groaned as I examined him.
I was relieved to find that he had done no more than
sprain his ankle. At this moment a figure emerged
from the shadows—it was Tapee.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You all right?—where’s Fae Fae?” said the old
man, as he peered into the jungle depths around us.
Fae Fae, who was hiding behind the dwarf coco-palms,
heard Tapee’s voice, and revealed herself. On sighting
the girl, the old idol-worshipper grinned from ear to ear.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You clever <i>wahine</i> to run way from palace with kind
white mans.”</p>

<p class='c009'>It appeared that O’Hara had acquainted the chief
that he was going to get Fae Fae to elope with him
from the palace that night. Tapee was delighted to be
of assistance to O’Hara, for he had some grudge against
Tautoa, the chief who was to marry Fae Fae. He was
also pleased to annoy Pomare, who had refused to allow
Tapee to attend the palace festivities.</p>

<p class='c009'>When I informed Tapee that the gendarmes were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>already on our track, he simply rubbed his hands and
grinned as though the trouble was over. Seeing O’Hara
standing on one leg and holding the other off the ground,
Tapee and I escorted him into the bungalow hard by.
He groaned as we laid him down on the bed mats.
On pulling off his boot I saw that he was quite out of
action so far as walking was concerned—his ankle was
swollen to the size of an orange, a lump on the off-side.</p>

<p class='c009'>Fae Fae, noticing the injury, gave a wail of despair.
Then Tapee, to my surprise, looked up and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Messieurs, what shall we do? The popy priest
am waiting to marry Fae Fae and Papalagi O’Hara all
this whiles down in Papeete.”</p>

<p class='c009'>This was the first intimation I had received that
O’Hara had made the necessary preparations to have a
Christian marriage with Fae Fae. It was just like
him, for, notwithstanding his being a scallawag, he was
ever ready to do the right thing at the right
moment.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go, quick, and let the priest know that the marriage
is put off till another night,” moaned O’Hara. And so
Tapee went off to postpone the wedding. Fae Fae lifted
her hands to the roof and wailed out, “Saprista! Aloe,
tua” and “Mon Dieu!” (Fae Fae spoke broken French
as well as English). I was more than glad to see that
wedding postponed. I felt it was quite enough for one
night’s work to abduct the maid in readiness for the
wedding, and, moreover, Fae Fae was trembling like
a leaf and appeared very neurotic. She was a very
high-strung girl. Indeed I saw how artful-hearted Tapee
had played with ease on the girl’s romantic, sensitive
temperament.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Tapee returned, about half an hour after, he
at once prepared supper. We were all famished. We
closed the door and bolted it. Tapee said that on his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>way back after seeing the priest, he had heard a lot
of French officials discussing Fae Fae’s disappearance
from the palace. O’Hara groaned and Fae Fae wept,
while I moodily ate mangoes and stewed, juicy fruits,
and wondered what my relatives would think when they
heard that I had been hanged for abducting maidens
in the South Seas! We passed a most wretched night.
I dozed off once, and dreamed that the world was a vast
guillotine, with me sitting in its receiving-basket as Time,
and all the stars danced sorrowfully around me, ere the
blade fell and severed my connection with mundane
things. When I awoke, O’Hara was looking very ill;
but he gave a faint smile as Fae Fae held his head and
passed her fingers through his curly hair. At daybreak
Tapee went out and hired a kind of <i>char-à-banc</i> owned
by a wizened Chinaman. We took the Chinaman into
our confidence, gave him a good tip, and promised him
a lot more than we could ever give him. To tell the
truth, if a Chinaman gives one his word of honour,
he seldom breaks it. I’d sooner trust a Chinaman than
many pious people whom I’ve unfortunately met. When
we got into that wagon the bottom nearly dropped out.
It was old and rotten. The horse was an object for
pity; it moved at a mile an hour, and the angles of its
bones looked decidedly like the angles of the guillotine.
We crouched in the bottom of the cart, safe from the
vigilant eyes of the officials who were on the look-out
for us. When we arrived in the Chinese quarter of
Papeete, I hired a room in a fan-tan den, and O’Hara
helped me to put up a bed. When all was comfortable,
O’Hara fell asleep, and I crept out into the forest and
went back to Tapee’s bungalow. When I arrived there,
Fae Fae was weeping bitterly. I saw that she had
become sane, and regretted her flight from the palace.
She was evidently terrified in her reflection over the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>punishment she would receive from the Queen’s hands. I
tried my best to soothe her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Monsieur, I so unhappy. Poor Monsieur Ilisham
hurt himself too. I feel lone, and Queen Pomare find
me out and punish me, I know, I know!” she
wailed.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t worry, Fae Fae,” said I soothingly, as she
gave me a tender, sympathetic glance. I saw the tears
in her eyes as she stared up at me through her dishevelled
tresses. Ah, beautiful hair it was! The room was dimly
lit by the latticed window-hole. She did look a plaintive
creature as she sat there swaying in her grief. I smelt
the sweet odours of the languishing flowers that still
dangled, clinging among her scented tresses, when she
placed her hand caressingly on my shoulder, and murmured:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, take me back to palace, Monsieur.”</p>

<p class='c009'>We were close together, her eyes gazing beseechingly
into mine. Her smooth brow, bright in the glory of
her vanilla-scented hair, was near my lips. God knows
that I would not betray the trust reposed in me by a
good comrade; but I have my weaknesses. Her hand
pressed mine. I somehow tripped forward, and, in some
inexplicable entanglement of the senses, my lips touched
hers. Ah me! She gazed deeply into my eyes. In a
moment I realized what I had done. I hung my head
as she gazed on, and then, to my astonishment, she
swiftly lifted my hand and kissed it passionately. I
thought of O’Hara, probably asleep on his bed-mat and
of the implicit trust he reposed in me. I made a tremendous
effort so that my outward demeanour should
have no twinship with the turmoil of conflicting thoughts
within me. Inclining my head affectionately, but at the
same time forcing a melancholy, sober aspect to my
blushing visage, I managed to blurt out:</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>“Oh, Fae Fae, child, my heart is heavy in the thoughts
of your sorrows. I don’t know how to advise you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a near go, I know. Indeed, had I partaken a
little more liberally of the toddy that Tapee had given
me from his huge flask, my memory of the whole business
would not have made such pleasant reading, I feel sure
of that. Sober reflections made me realize that, under
the circumstance, the best thing for the girl to do would
be to go back to the palace. I fully realized the clumsy
way we had conducted ourselves and the seriousness of
the gendarmes being on our tracks.</p>

<p class='c009'>At this moment Tapee opened the door and walked
in. I was relieved by his presence, but, to my consternation,
Fae Fae’s attitude towards me remained
the same! Kissing the girl again, as though she were a
child, I looked her straight in the eyes, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I must get away and see O’Hara; it is unsafe for
me to stop here.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl responded to this only by falling on her
knees before me.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Monsieur, stay! stay!” she cried in a plaintive
voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was then I noticed the wild, strange stare of her
eyes. I gave Tapee an interrogative glance. He touched
his brow significantly. I did not quite comprehend
his meaning at the time, but subsequent events soon
enlightened me as to the state of Fae Fae’s mind.
Promising Tapee and the girl that I would return soon,
I hastened from their presence and went back to O’Hara.
He was awake and in great pain when I arrived at our
diggings. I sat with him till dusk, and all through the
night poured cold water on his sprained ankle.</p>

<p class='c009'>I well knew that while he was lame we had little
chance of clearing away, if the gendarmes heard of our
whereabouts.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>Once again, at O’Hara’s request, I went off to see how
Fae Fae was. Arriving at Tapee’s bungalow I found
him trembling and muttering in a strange way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s the matter?” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, Masser, she gone! She run away in night; she
go kill herself, I sure!”</p>

<p class='c009'>After the old fellow had rambled on a good deal, I
gathered that he had awakened at daybreak, and,
discovering that Fae Fae had flown, had spent the
morning in searching likely places where she might have
hidden herself. I at once got Tapee to send a trusted
native friend up to the palace to find out if Fae Fae had
returned home. After a while the native came back
full of excitement, and informed us that the Queen and
her retinue of chiefs had gone off to the French Presidency
to inform the officials that Princess Fae Fae had
been abducted from the palace by two white men. That
bit of information seemed to waken me up. I left Tapee
at once.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s no good using language like that,” I said, chidingly
to O’Hara, as I rubbed his ankle with coco-nut
oil.</p>

<p class='c009'>By the next day he could just manage to limp along.
He was determined to search for Fae Fae, though I had
tried to persuade him to do otherwise. That same day
he seemed very depressed as he sat under the palms
singing to me. (He always sang when he was feeling
melancholy.)</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’ll do herself some injury,” he said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’ll turn up,” I said soothingly, though I must
admit I felt dubious about it all. I thought of the girl’s
strange manner, how she had danced round that idol;
I was convinced that she was no ordinary girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>That same evening we walked into the forest near
Katavio. We were intending to meet Tapee, who had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>informed us that he would be in his old hut in that part
of the forest where his idol was hidden.</p>

<p class='c009'>I tried to cheer O’Hara up as we passed under the
arch-like banyans that grew on the outskirts of the
wooded country. Then we sat down by the lagoons
till darkness came. Suddenly we were startled by
hearing far-off sounds like the singing of a woman’s
beautiful voice. I jumped to my feet. There was something
eerie about the night as we listened. Then it came
again, the long, low, sweet refrain of an old-time
Tahitian <i>himine</i>. Bucking up our courage we stole
forward, making for the direction where the singing
came from. Even the winds seemed hushed, not a sound
disturbing the silence of the forest. It seemed as if
O’Hara and I walked a stage whereon some thrilling
South Sea drama was being enacted; the tall trees looked
unreal, even the wide roof over us might have been some
tremendous dark canvas bespangled with stars. The
weird, flute-like cadenza of the nightingale up in the
branches of the flamboyants did not destroy the unreal
effect as it flew off.</p>

<p class='c009'>“This way,” I whispered, as my comrade limped
along.</p>

<p class='c009'>We were standing on the wooded elevation just before
the spot where we had first caught Tapee worshipping
his wooden image. Moonrise, somewhere to the southward,
behind the mountains, was sending a pale brilliance
over the rugged landscape. That weird singer of the
forest, or whatever it was, had ceased to sing. Then it
came again, a weird, tender wailing! O’Hara’s big
form was leaning against mine when the surprise came:
staring there between the tree trunks, we saw the old
idol again and, careering around that hideous wooden
deity, that which looked like a phantom girl of the
woods! I had travelled the world over and seen some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>strange things, but had never seen so weird a sight before.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s Fae Fae,” said O’Hara, as he stumbled on his
sprained ankle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Impossible!” I responded in a mechanical way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She’s dead, and has come back to dance where she
first met me!” re-wailed my love-sick Irish comrade.</p>

<p class='c009'>The girl <i>did</i> look misty! I looked and wondered, notwithstanding
my cynicism over such things as ghosts.
I felt that perhaps it was Fae Fae’s ghost dancing before
us! I had read of such things, and had met old women
who swore they had seen the dead doing strange, unaccountable
things.</p>

<p class='c009'>We both stood still, strangely calm, as the girl whirled
and sang in her wild career, her diaphanous robe fluttering
out to the breeze or clinging closely to her misty-like
figure. Then she lifted her arms and moved towards
us, her eyes wide open, apparently staring into vacancy.
The flowers in her unkempt hair, all crumpled, gave
the <i>one</i> touch that told of something real. It was
evident that she had not observed us, for in another
moment she was again whirling around the space,
chanting to the deaf, wooden ears of the massive idol.
As she passed by us she came so close that I felt the
rush of cool air caused by her swift movements. Though
her figure looked ghost-like, I was still extremely sceptical.
I knew that mortality, when transformed into that
blessed spiritual state that is supposed to follow death,
must of a necessity be unable to create any impression
through coming into contact with the material elements
of mortality. Indeed, I knew that singing itself was an
impossibility, since it necessitated an inflection and perfect
contraction in the throat of the singer. I resolved
to seize the first opportunity to substantiate my human
suspicions as to the possibility of the figure before us
being a transfiguration of her whom we had once known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>in mortal shape as Fae Fae. The opportunity presented
itself forthwith. Fae Fae’s apparent wraith, with arms
outspread, the body swerving with rhythmical beauty,
was still flitting noiselessly round the small space, coming
toward us!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Keep back!” I whispered to O’Hara, who was
staring over my shoulder, endeavouring to get a better
glimpse of the figure. On she came, seemingly draped
in veils of the moonlight that was falling through the
overspreading, dark-fingered palm-leaves. Her lips had
begun a chant, her head turned slightly sideways as
on her tripping flight she approached and stared at the
mighty, yellow-toothed, wooden deity. In a moment
she was upon us. I swiftly thrust forth my hand as she
flitted past.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A phantom!” I gasped, as my fist passed right
<i>through</i> the folds of her attire and then seemingly
through her form! For a moment I could only stare.
A vulture screeched high in the banyans. O’Hara
crossed himself and murmured a portion of some <i>Ave
Maria</i>, terror-struck. “Impossible! preposterous!”
thought I to myself. Then I remembered how I had
distinctly felt the material of her robes appeal to my
sense of touch as my fist apparently went through her
figure; yes, something real and material was there. I
had simply missed touching her solid figure; that was it,
I felt sure. “O’Hara,” I whispered, and my voice
sounded cracked as I muttered, “it’s no ghost; it’s her,
Fae Fae, right enough. She’s mad, out of her mind!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No! Mad!” groaned O’Hara, as he jumped down
from the banyan bough where he had leapt in fright,
and peered between the breadfruit trunks. I tried
hard to hold him back as he rushed forward; but it
was too late—a piece of his ragged coat came off in my
hand!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>Fae Fae gave a terrified scream as she spied him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s me! your O’Hara, darlint!” yelled my comrade,
as the girl, turning round, stared at him in a wild, vacant
way. Then, with a frightened scream that thrilled us
with horror, she fled away into the depths of the
forest.</p>

<p class='c009'>I also rushed off, following O’Hara, who bolted after
her. He had not gone far when he tripped and fell with
a crash. He gave a groan as he held up his afflicted
foot. I at once came to a standstill. I was not in the
mood to go chasing after a mad native girl. Besides,
I had had about sufficient of O’Hara’s love affairs.
O’Hara was inconsolable that night. At daybreak we
were up and ready to go forth in an endeavour to hear
something about Fae Fae. Indeed, O’Hara seemed
more determined than ever to find her. We had at first
intended to go and see Tapee; but Tapee saved us that
trouble by suddenly walking into our apartments. Before
we could get a chance to tell the old chief of our
adventure with Fae Fae, he had started gabbling like one
demented.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fae Fae, she go mad! and, O Papalagi, that
Tautoa, her lover, he have found her crying in the night
in the forest, all ’lone,” said the old dark man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No!” we both exclaimed in one breath.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, yes, Messieurs, it all-e-samee true. Fae Fae am
now back in palace, they got her now, and Queen Pomare
am in terrible rage with white mans. I knower that she
am going to send gendarmes after you and Monsieur
O’Hara.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The way O’Hara raved and carried on is indescribable.
He got quite drunk before midday. Then we were
obliged to fly from our lodgings and hide away under
Tapee’s protection. For, sure enough, a warrant was
really out for both O’Hara and myself for trespass and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>the abduction of Fae Fae, who from childhood had
suffered from mental afffliction!</p>

<p class='c009'>It was Tapee who gave us this last bit of information.
As the old chief crept into the disused native hut and,
squatting down by us, told us these things, much became
clear to me. I recalled many things about Fae Fae’s
manner, which, though fascinating and romantic, seemed
out of the normal even in a native maid. We hid in
that hut for three days, safe from the French officials;
but I felt pretty gloomy as I thought of the prospect
of our getting three years in the island calaboose. I gave
out no hint of my qualms to O’Hara, but I well knew
that there was a good chance of both of us being transported
to the convict settlement at <i>Ill Nou</i>, Noumea!
The following night, however, we secured an old canoe,
through the help of Tapee, and paddled round to
Matavai Bay, where we heard that a tramp steamer
was anchored.</p>

<p class='c009'>And the next day, as we heard the tramping far
overhead and the dull pomp-e-te-pomp of engines, we
both crept forth, moved our cramped, huddled limbs,
and groaned. I chewed a morsel off one of our four
coco-nuts. Then I caught a shadowy glimpse of
O’Hara’s sweating black face as he took a drink from the
water-bottle, and groped with his hands amongst the
tiers of coal and terrific heat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on, this way!” I gasped, as I crawled along
in that monstrous tomb where we found ourselves buried
alive! “That’s better!” I said, as I felt a whiff of
purer air come along some dark, labyrinthine way.
O’Hara sat by me in the gloom, groping about as he
carefully replaced the water-bottle and coco-nut in my
portmanteau (an old green baize bag that I always carried
when I travelled <i>incognito</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>Then O’Hara climbed up on my shoulders and peered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>through the little round hole just above our heads.
For a long time he stared, gazing away to the far south-west
horizon, where rose the rugged pinnacles of La
Diadem, still visible.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re safe enough now. They won’t catch us, I’ll
bet,” said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, my darlint Fae Fae! I’ll never be happy again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, you will,” I murmured soothingly, as O’Hara
still gazed through that dirty coal-bunker’s glass porthole,
staring wistfully so as to get the last glimpse, as
sunset touched the mountain palms of far-away Tahiti!
We were stowaways down in the hold of a tramp steamer,
far out at sea, outbound for Honolulu!</p>

  <h2 id='ch07' class='c007'>CHAPTER VII. THE HEATHEN’S GARDEN OF EDEN</h2>
</div>
<p class='c017'>Tangalora the Samoan Scribe—Where the Gods and
Goddesses first met in Council—The Materials of which
the first Mortal Children were Fashioned—The first
Wondering Men—The first Women—How the first
Babies came to their Mothers.</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c008'>IT was nearly three months before I found myself
in Samoa again. O’Hara had shipped from Hawaii
for the Solomon Isles, and I had signed on as “deckhand”
on a fore-and-aft schooner that was bound for
Apia. I missed the society of my Irish comrade; but
we met long after, as will be seen in the last chapters
of this book. However, I soon made another friend,
for I came across a high chief, Tangalora, who was an
aged Samoan. I came to value his friendship greatly.
He dwelt in a cave on the shores of Savaii Isle, a cave
wherein he lived in primitive comfort and seemed happy
enough. He was one of the last of the wandering
Samoan scribes—men who, with tappa robe flung across
the left shoulder, wandered from village to village in
pursuit of their romantic calling. These scribes would
enter the small pagan villages at sunset, take their
stand on the village forum-stump (sometimes a tree
trunk or a heap of coral stone that denoted where some
mighty warrior or poet was buried), then, lifting one arm
towards the sky, commence to pour forth in dramatic
fashion their own versions of the old mythological tales
and legends. Such a scribe was Tangalora, with whom
I became on the most intimate terms. As I have said,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>Tangalora was a very old man. I believe he was nearly
eighty years of age. Consequently, he was unable to
travel from village to village singing his romantic
chants and legends to Samoan maids and youths. I
found him a most agreeable old poet, perfect in every
way, except that I noticed a tinge of jealousy arose
whenever I spoke of his contemporaries. But even that
very human failing was forgivable, for competition was
keen among the poets of those days, and I myself heard
many followers of the Muse, as they stood on those
Parnassian heathen slopes, cursing the lying tongue of
some wandering scribe who had forestalled them by
arriving at the forum-stump before they did. However,
it’s not my wish to go into detail over Tangalora’s
failings; all I will attempt is to tell from my own impressions
some of the incidents of the <i>extempore</i> verse which
he rattled off in his cavern homestead. I must first say
that he used this cavern as a lecture hall as well as a
homestead, charging a small fee to the native men and
crowds of children who collected outside his rocky door
at sunset. It was a sight worth seeing as those little
native children, their eyes bright with mystery, waited
to enter the cavern and hear the wonderful old wizard
man, Tangalora, tell of the mysteries of shadowland. It
was such a sight that met my eyes when I arrived at that
cavern’s entrance, as eager as any of the forest children,
I am sure.</p>

<p class='c009'>The sun was setting on the sea skyline and the shadows
falling over the mountains as Tangalora sat on his coral
throne at the far end of his weird-lit cavern hall. He
was fully decorated with all the insignia of his office,
wearing his tappa robe, and with his ornamental war-club
by his side, as he sat there before me.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Talofa!” he said, and all the children responded:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Talofa, O Tangalora!”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>Then he said that which translated into our language
would run in this wise:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now then, <i>fantoes</i> (children), come round close to
me, my sight is dim; sit by my knees, for I am old.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In a moment the tawny children of the south were
hustling and bustling to secure their favourite position
at the feet of the aged poet. Placing his hand to his
wrinkled mouth, he coughed twice, as he always did ere
he commenced to tell his stories.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you all here?” His voice trembled into echoes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are all here!” cried the children, as they crossed
their arms and legs and prepared to listen attentively.
Then he began as follows:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Thousands of years ago, when the sun, the moon,
and the stars shone in the sky and saw no one alive
on the isles of these seas, the heathen gods were walking
across the wide floors of Mbau. Suddenly Raitumaibulii,
who was the god of Fruit and Taro, said: ‘I say, look
at that great ocean shining under the sun down there
above unpeopled, palm-clad isles.’ Then the god continued:
‘Is it not a shame that all those beautiful palms
and those breadfruit trees of mine should be laden with
such nice fruit and yet none there to eat of it?’ ‘It
really does seem a pity,’ replied the god of Fire; and
he continued: ‘I also think it sad that none can light
fires in those deep forests. Look how comfortable they
would feel were they to see my flames brightly shining
beneath the palms by night.’ As the god Raitumaibulii
and the god of Fire ceased speaking and sighed over
their thoughts, the beautiful heathen goddess of Mburoto
(the Paradise of Love and Bliss) came up to them and
said: ‘Ah! I have just heard your lament. I too feel
sad to think that there are no handsome youths and
maidens in those beautiful leafy forests.’ As the two
gods listened and gazed on her beauty, she lifted her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>hands and lovely eyes towards the mountains of
Mburoto, and continued in this wise: ‘Oh! think how
pleased the moons would be to light up the eyes of handsome
lovers and reveal the bronze-hued faces of pretty
maidens if they roamed those now silent lands.’ It was
then that the great Thangi-Thangi, the god of Hate and
Sin, stepped forth. He, too, looked thoughtfully down
on those far-distant beautiful isles and murmured:
‘What a waste, what a waste it is, when I think how
I could make the folk of a world to hate each other and
deeply sin.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“The goddess of Love, who was listening to Thangi-Thangi,
said: ‘Look here, you are not wanted down
there. I know well enough that if you had anything to
do with the making of the folk of another world, they
would never be really happy folk.’ As the beautiful
goddess said this, her daughter came forward. She had
eyes like unto fire, and a serpent was nestling at her
breast. Gazing up into the face of the goddess of Love,
she said: ‘I am Jealousy, your sinful child; but may I
help you to make the new folk for that lovely country,
those silent isles so far away, down there?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“For a long time the goddess of Love gazed across the
terraced mountains of Mbau. As she reflected, her
hands were arched over her eyes that shone like two
lovely moons that had a bright star in their centre.
Slowly turning, she gazed sadly into her daughter’s dark,
fiery eyes, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘I suppose you <i>must</i> come and help me when I am
making handsome men and beautiful women. Of course,
I shall have to make a few ugly mortals, so that the
favoured ones may see that they are handsome.’ Then
the goddess sighed and said: ‘So you must be there to
kiss their lips, that they may have the spirit to look
after the <i>one</i> they love.’</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>“After the gods and goddesses of Mbau had assembled
in solemn council, they decided that it would be best to
make living people who could be happy on the isles
situated away down beneath the sun. ‘So shall it be,’
they all muttered, as they stalked across the magic
mountains of Mburoto, where they at once began to
gather wonderful flowers and weeds, stones, bits of fire,
and cloudy skeins of moonlight and starlight. For it
was from the essential materials of Paradise that they
must make the children of the world that was beneath
the sun.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was then that the aged goddess of Sorrow, who
had stood silently behind, said: ‘I also must come to
help you.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Must you come?’ said the goddess of Love. And
the goddess of Sorrow replied: ‘It must be I alone
who shall gather the compassionate cry of the winds
in the forest, the bundles of old sunsets, the long-ago
wail of blue sea-waves, and the songs of melancholy,
small-throated birds.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘But must we have such things? Cannot we make
children without your help, O goddess of Sorrow?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“And Sorrow answered: ‘However beautiful you
made the children, even though their eyes were like
unto the beauty of thine own, still they would not be
happy without being fashioned of those things that I
must gather from the graves of a million dead moons.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘So shall it be,’ said the goddess of Love, as she
sighed and kissed Sorrow’s tender, trembling hand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Now then!’ said Atuaa, the chief vassal of Ndengi.
‘Come along! Come along!’ Then, lo! on the beams
of threaded moonlight that were falling down the
heavens of shadowland into the dark regions of the
other world, the gods and goddesses slid softly away,
monstrous, shadowy figures as they passed down, down
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>through the deep skies! For a long time their cloudy
figures seemed to be falling. At last they stood, mighty
shadows in the silent forest of the isles far to the westward.
They were all much taller than the trees, their
huge heads rising far above the forest height, as their
images moved across the sky. It was the god of Hate
who first spoke after they had stepped into the forest
of Time. He said: ‘I say, we must be very careful
not to make these new children as big and as strong
as we ourselves are.’ For a long time the hands of the
gods and goddesses were busy, as they toiled silently,
mixing up the materials in the bundles they had brought
with them. Before sunrise appeared on the sea’s horizon,
the gods had hurried back to the skies, and were watching
to see what would happen. Now the gods and
goddesses had not long left the lonely forest when old
Silence trembled in his cave at hearing the jabbering
and scampering about of unusual things amongst his
solemn trees. An extraordinary thing had happened,
for, as the light of the sun stared down through the
branches of the coco-palms, six newly-created men
yawned, jumped to their new, soft, brown clay feet,
and gazed on each other in mute astonishment. ‘Who
am I? Who are you?’ It sounded like echoes answering
each other in a cave, as each one gabbled forth, ‘Who
am I? Who are you?’ For a long time they babbled
thus. Then they all stepped forward and said to each
other: ‘Let us all be happy, and care not at all who we
may be.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Saying this, they rubbed noses and became <i>ma
pataro</i> (good friends). Now, just behind the bamboos
and mangroves, not a spear’s throw from where they
were gabbling and rubbing noses, stood six newly-created
maidens. These maidens also gazed at each other in
astonishment and cried out: ‘Who are we? Who are
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>we?’ Then in some fright embraced, much the same
as the men had done, and said: ‘What matters it who
we are, so long as we are really here?’ and then they ran
down to the seashore.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The sun had risen and set thrice when the maids
danced on the shore, all singing some song which they
had learnt from the soft murmurings of a seashell.
Each had clad her form in a small lava-lava that was
made of seaweed and fastened by threaded grass about
the loins. Standing on the big lumps of red coral, they
all dived into the ocean, to come forth laughing, as the
sea-water fell glistening from their tresses that half hid
their soft feet. ‘Oh, how lovely this world really is!’
they said, as they lifted seashells to their ears, and, singing
again, dived headlong into the ocean. It so happened
that the six newly-created men had made up their minds
to go down and bathe in the cool sea-water; and, as
they gazed through the belt of mangroves, they suddenly
gave a cry of astonishment. One said: ‘Did ever
one see such figures?’ Another, swallowing the lump
that came to his throat, said: ‘’Tis more wonderful
than finding ourselves in this lonely forest to see such
divine figures.’ Then yet another cried: ‘They must
have come to us out of the night and the starlight by
way of the Dawn!’ Then, half in fright, they crept
down towards the shore so that they might see the maids
the plainer. ‘Vanaka! Vanaka!’ they cried, losing their
heads through seeing all that they did see. Being foolish,
as men have always been, they rushed forth from the
shadows of the mangroves, in haste to embrace the
maids. The maidens, looking up in wonder at hearing
other voices, all screamed out in astonishment: ‘Oh,
look, such figures!—why, surely, more lovely than we
are!’ Then, seeing that the figures were rushing down
the shores towards them, they huddled in fright together,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>then, hastily lifting their loosened tresses that dangled
down to their feet, they ran off towards the forest of
breadfruit trees. One, who possessed a figure like a goddess,
lagged behind the others as they raced up the shore,
for so long was her hair that it became entangled in her
swiftly moving feet. Suddenly she fell down on the
glistening sand. The six pursuing newly-created men
shouted with joy on observing the maiden’s distress.
He who ran first was a handsome youth. In a moment
he had reached the side of the fallen maid, who, struggling
to regain her feet, glanced despairingly over her
shoulder up into the eyes of him who leaned over her.
The maid half turned her form whilst she still lay in a
reclining position. So exquisite was the sight to him who
had captured her that he nearly swooned, and so it happened
that, ere the others came up, the maid had once
more regained her feet and had sped off into the forests.
Hiding amongst the trees and flowers, the girls hastily
plucked hibiscus blossoms and palm-leaves. The flowers
they swiftly placed in their hair, and, hurriedly threading
the leaves with grass, they wrapped them about their
loins. ‘Was it not foolish to run away from such
figures?’ said a tall maiden, who had soft, warm eyes
like unto stars in a pool. ‘It was! It was!’ they cried
together, as they leaned over the lagoon and gazed sideways
on their images, swerving slightly that they might
discover why they were so fascinating. Seeing the men
no more, they all sat down on the edge of the lagoon and
wept bitterly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Next day they searched and searched the forest
till at last they found the men; and, lo! the men fell
down on their knees before them, and the maids blushed
exceedingly, their eyes sparkling with much joy. Ere
the moon had faded to the size of a bird’s underwing,
the maidens were full of jealousy, grief, and sorrow, for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>they were each in love with the very one who loved
another. When the gods of the shadowland (who were,
of course, aware of all that had happened) heard the
moans and wailing lamentations of the men and women
whom they had created, they said: ‘What <i>shall</i> we do
now? We have made children of the forest, and lo,
have mixed them up the wrong way!’</p>

<p class='c009'>“The goddess of Love gazed sorrowfully across the
stars, and said: ‘I must see what can be done for them,
for now that we have made them they are our
children.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then all the gods and goddesses stamped their feet
in grief, and, crying out as with one voice, said: ‘What
shall we do now that we have made the first children of
the forest wrong?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“The goddesses of Love and Passion replied: ‘We
must now give unto them little children of their own;
then they will throw the blame of their sorrows on
themselves instead of on us who made them.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then the goddess of Love continued: ‘Come on!
Come on!’ and at once started to move towards the
mountains of Mburoto, and all the gods sadly followed
her. And when they stood beneath the mighty tree that
threw branches of night across all the skies and blossomed
the bright-fingered stars, she said: ‘Stay! It
is here that we must gather the materials for the children
of the children of this new world which we have made.’
Saying this, she stooped and gathered little bits of starlight.
And the gods and goddesses, who followed close
behind her, said: ‘What’s that for?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘That’s for the little ones’ eyes,’ answered the goddess
of Love. Then she gathered some tiny red flowers
that were always murmuring music to the soft winds on
the mountain side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘What’s that for?’ murmured all the gods.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>“‘Why, that’s to make the children’s tiny mouths
with.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then the goddess looked up and gave a soft whistle;
and down from the beautiful palm trees of Mburoto
came fluttering to her feet small, black-breasted
birds.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Lift your heads up, O little birds!’ she said, as they
all sang to her. Then, as they still whistled and whistled,
she stooped down and with her forefinger tenderly
brushed the dark down from each breast.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘What’s that stuff for?’ growled the old Thangi-Thangi,
the god of Hate and Sin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Why, that is for the hair on their tiny heads.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then the goddess said: ‘Come on! Come on!’ and
led the way to the edge of the mighty threshold of <i>Atua</i>
(Elysium).</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then she threw out a long fishing-net, and it fell
away down the skies. As she pulled it up very gently,
it was full of old sunsets and old broken moons.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘What’s that stuff for?’ murmured the gods, as the
hills around were lit up with a sad, beautiful light.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Why, that is to make their little hearts with; I
would have them love and worship us, these children
that we have made, so that when they die, their spirits
will come back again to shadowland.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then she led them across the wide halls of Mburoto,
till they came to the lagoons that were the shining mirrors
of the gods and goddesses.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘O gods and goddesses of shadowland, bend forward
and gaze into the deep waters so that your eyes
will be imaged therein!’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Leaning forward, they all gazed into their own
mirrored eyes, thinking the while deeply of all that they
wished. The mirrored eyes of the god of Hate gleamed
like fire; Jealousy’s eyes stared and stared; and Mercy’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>eyes gazed back with tenderest beams into the eyes of
Love and her sister, Beauty.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Don’t move!’ said the goddess, as she swiftly
threw her magic fishing-net into the lagoon, and caught
the shining, mirrored eyelight of the gods and goddesses.
Picking it out of the net very tenderly with her fingers,
she placed the gleaming lumps of mystical light into her
wonderful bundle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Is that all?’ thundered Poluto, the Master-of-all-Desires,
as he stamped his feet with impatience when the
goddess stooped yet again and plucked the golden flowers
that danced in laughter at her feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Is that all?’ he thundered yet again, as she put the
flowers in the bundle, and then fastened her robe of the
western winds about her tall, glorious form!</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Alas! it is not enough,’ she responded, as she gazed
tenderly into the eyes of impatient Desire, and made
great pretence to hasten. For well she knew that he
wanted nothing more than that!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, in single file, the gods and goddesses tramped
back the way they had come, and their tall shadows
moved along the mighty walls of the moonlit mountains.</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c009'>“Next night, while the moonbeams were shining over
the small grass-huts that the poor mortals had made, so
that they could sleep, a shadow passed across the whole
of the sky. It was the goddess of Love. She had arrived
down in the depths of the forest wherein dwelt
the sad, newly-created mortals. She was so tall that
she was obliged to use magic and so make herself small.
When she had shrunken up till she was only about four
times as big as a mortal, she could walk with ease beneath
the tall forest trees. Taking a lump of red clay
out of the earth, she strode deeper into the forest glooms.
Standing beneath a giant breadfruit tree, she made a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>little fire out of the old moonlights and dead forest twigs.
Often and often she blew its little flame. Then, at last,
it burnt steadily with a blue light.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then she started to make tiny figures out of the red
clay! Opening her bundle, she carefully took out bits
of old sunsets and starlight. For a long time she was
very busy, toiling and toiling with her fingers, as she
moulded little arms, legs, and small feet. When she
had completed her task and had set the little figures
all upright in a row, she very tenderly put small pinches
of sunset and starlight into the little holes she had made
beneath their brows. Then she whispered, and it
sounded as though a wind went moaning through the
forest trees, and lo! the small figures all looked up at
her, for their eyes were made. Then she said once
again: ‘Now, little forest children, gaze upon me.’
Then all the eyes of the small clay figures turned and
gazed on her! ‘Now put out your hands, and stamp,
so, with your feet.’ At once the little marionettes
obeyed, stamped their feet and put forth their arms.
When the goddess had gazed approvingly at her own
handiwork, she looked round the silent forest, and said:
‘Come, my little ones, follow me.’ Then she strode
across the forest. And the tiny clay figures, looking
round with curiosity, followed her, half frightened, as
they kept close to the big ankles of the goddess who had
made them. Their little eyes shone like tiny constellations
of wandering stars, as they followed their creator
through the depth of those forest glooms.</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c009'>“At dawn, when the mortals awoke from sleep, sunrise
was streaming through the grass roofs of their huts.
As they all jumped up and gazed with astonishment at
the sight they saw, the maidens, who had slept not far
away, cried out: ‘Oh, how beautiful, to be sure!’ For,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>lo!—a flock of pretty <i>fantoes</i> (children) were peeping
into their wondering eyes, laughing and clapping their
tiny hands as they cried out: ‘Oh, we are your children;
the gods and goddesses of Mbau have sent us to
look after you!’</p>

<p class='c009'>“After that the people multiplied on the island, till
there were so many that some were obliged to go forth
and dwell on other isles of the South Seas. And they
were all happy for a long, long time, for they did not
have time hanging on their hands, so they were not
jealous, nor did they quarrel overmuch.”</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c009'>“Tafola, me slo!” cried the children, as Tangalora
finished his story.</p>

<p class='c009'>Thereupon the old scribe hastened round with his
coco-nut-shell goblet to make the usual collection. The
children immediately threw in the coins which their
mothers had given them, so that they might pay on a fair
royalty basis for the wonders which the tattooed Homer
of their isles had told them. I flung in two bits of silver;
and, considering all that I had heard, it was cheap at the
price. Then the children, giving a musical halloo that
echoed through that small Olympus, scrambled out of
the cavern and disappeared in the forest.</p>

<p class='c009'>Tangalora entertained me right royally that night, not
only by relating a lot of the fascinating storied history
of heathenland, but because of his thoughtfulness: he
slyly pulled a piece of sacking from an old barrel, and
brought forth twelve bottles of sparkling Bass’s ale!
Squatting there, on Tangalora’s best fibre mat, things
took on quite a rosy look as I listened whilst the summer
night grew old. Then I bade my host good-night and
went outside in the open to rest. There’s a good deal
of mythology in Bass’s ale: I know that much. When
I had made my bed beneath the palms and carefully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>placed my quilt of moss over my tired frame, I distinctly
saw the moon cheerfully wave a pale hand over the
highest pinnacle of Vae’s mountain range. It did not
seem strange that the midnight moon should laugh, and,
sneezing, send a tiny spiral of mist across the clear sky.
All was as it should be when a magnificent procession
of mighty gods and goddesses from Poluto marched
across my bedroom floor, and disappeared in the adjacent
glooms ere I closed my eyes in sleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>Referring to my diary and the scraps which I wrote
down in those old days, I find the notes considerably
mixed up, parts quite obliterated through my sea-chest
getting washed about on sailing-ships. Many of the
pages are missing. But my memory is good, and I can
easily fill in the interminable gaps. Indeed, the best
part of this book is being written within the sounds of
the winds in the palms. The dark, sombre green of
the tropic landscape stretches for miles and miles.
There lies the expanse of the sapphire-hued ocean, ending
far away in the pale saffron fires of the skyline’s sunset,
as, in my imagination, I softly dip my pen into the
magic foams that sparkle on the coral-dust sands at my
feet and sigh with the coco-palms overhead.</p>

<p class='c009'>I see by my notes that I have already recorded in
my previous books<a id='r4' /><a href='#f4' class='c019'><sup>[4]</sup></a> many of the incidents connected
with my visit to Samoa at this period. And, having
also previously related much that befell me on my first
voyage to Nuka Hiva and Hiva oa, I have no alternative
but to revert to the incidents of a very interesting
experience which came to me after I had “jumped ship”
in Fiji. And this I will do in the next chapter.</p>

</div>
<p class='c017'>A Heathen Monastery—A scene of Primitive Heathenism—My
unsolicited Professional Engagement—I imbibe
Kava—I am made “Taboo”—Things that I may not
Confess—My escape—Fanga Loma—A Native Village—The
Enchantress of the Forest—Temptation—In Suva
again.</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c008'>I&nbsp;RECALL that, though my profession has never burdened
me with wealth till it seemed an encumbrance,
my violin has enabled me to delve without harm
into the most secretive, dangerous heathen societies and
sacred festivals. Where a white man would have been,
in the ordinary way, clubbed, or doped with a mixture
of kava and South Sea strychnine for intruding at a
secret sacred festival, I have been received with open
arms. It seems incredible, when I think of the magnificent
receptions I have had through being able to play
my old Sunday-school hymns on a fiddle before ex-cannibal
chiefs.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was in Suva, Fiji, when I managed to wheedle my
way into a heathen monastery that was the one surviving
temple of another age. This sacred hell was situated
in a picturesque spot up in the Kai Tholos mountains.
These Kai Tholos tribes were a fierce mountain people
who, up till that date, had successfully resisted the advances
of the British missionaries. Few of them were
still living, but those few most certainly did their best
to make up for the iniquities of the missing when they
met in their temple cavern four miles west of Mandaua,
not far from the Rewa River. The aforesaid river
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>ran through an isolated district in those days. Where
now the new sugar and coffee plantations are, there
was nothing more than a few taro and pineapple patches
that supplied the scattered villages with work and
food.</p>

<p class='c009'>How I got to know the whereabouts of the aforesaid
monastery matters little. I will simply say that an elder
chief, named Kambo, secured me uninterrupted admission
into the cavern-chamber where the old unconverted
Kai Tholos assembled for religious purposes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Only a poet of superb descriptive ability could adequately
describe that cavern’s interior and its romantic
surroundings. All I am able to say of the local scenery
is, that the mountains seemed to abet, to watch over
those wild Kai Tholos and their secret meetings, for ever
guarding the cavern’s entrance with their rugged hollows
and pinnacles that were clad with feathery palms
and the innocent flowerage of artless Nature. It was
like entering some wondrous <i>Arabian Nights</i> cave of
enchantment to enter that volcanic chamber.</p>

<p class='c009'>“In there?” I said to old Kambo, as I stood hesitating,
looking across the silent gullies, watching the migrating
cockatoos fade away in the aftermath of the sunset
ere I made up my mind to enter.</p>

<p class='c009'>The large red feathers in Kambo’s mop-head brushed
against the low roof of the tunnel-way as we both entered
that ominous-looking entrance. The glittering
stalactites, hanging in festoons from the rocky alcoves,
intensified the weird atmosphere of that gloomy place,
as, with fiddle in my hand, I crept warily behind my
swarthy guide. We had to stoop, almost crawl, as we
passed along into the third corridor. Great was my surprise
as I suddenly entered a spacious chamber. The
scene before me almost dazzled my eyes, for beneath the
hanging rows of innumerable coco-nut-oil lamps, suspended
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>over a large platform, danced a group of dusky,
sparkling-eyed houris!</p>

<p class='c009'>I stared like one in a dream as I continued to gaze
on those whirling, semi-nude figures. A few were attired
in diaphanous tappa robes, that seemed to be worn for
no other purpose than for the fact that they softly
opened out like large umbrellas and then closed down
again. I am at a loss to know how to describe the
dances and the various “turns” those maids gave, as
they sought to give the onlookers a violent, demonstrative
exhibition of their charms. Some whirled, some
somersaulted, and a few seemed to detach their limbs
from their bodies and gently throw them, in boomerang-like
swerves, across the stage, ere they returned and
fixed themselves by apparent magic into their customary
position. So it seemed to me, for I am at a loss to give
any reasonable explanation of maidens pitching their
legs and arms in such a way as they did, without dislocation,
if not serious injury and strain. It is quite
possible that they had been trained from early childhood,
like to our own contortionists and music-hall
dancers, so that they might please the eyes of sinful
old priests.</p>

<p class='c009'>Squatting on coco-nut-fibre mats, arranged in semicircles,
reposed the most hideous-looking chiefs it has
ever been my lot to gaze upon. They were tattooed in
grotesque style from toes to chin, their teeth reddened
through chewing betel-nut. They were undoubtedly the
surviving grand old roués of the pre-Christian times. To
the indescribable capers of the sacred maids, they gave
enthusiastic grunts and awful wheezes, and the effect
of it all was weird enough as the sounds echoed and
re-echoed ere they escaped from the close atmosphere
of that subterranean chamber.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Woi! Woi! Vanaka!” they yelled. Then several
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>old women lifted magic sticks, with sponges on the ends,
and wiped dribble from their ugly mouths!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kasawayo! Kasawayo!” the whole audience yelled,
as a pretty Fijian princess stepped from the alcove to
the right of the stage, did a seemingly impossible somersault,
and gave a characteristic bow. The audience gazed
on her in breathless silence. She was arrayed in a most
picturesque style; the gleams of the hanging oil-lamps
falling upon her made her appear like some goddess.
About her waist was a girdle of shells and flowers that
dangled down to her knees. But that which attracted
me most was the manner of the timid obeisances which
she repeatedly paid the monstrous wooden idol that an
old priest had placed in front of her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Whathi! Whathi, Ndengi!” the audience yelled, as
she prostrated herself before the image. Sometimes
she burst into blood-curdling peals of laughter and beat
the floor with her limbs. Her skull must have been extremely
thick, for she repeatedly crashed her head on
the floor without any apparent harm coming to it. She
looked like some weird enchantress as she went through
the heathen rites which were mimicked in the old ship’s
saloon mirror that was stuck up against the cavern’s
wall just beside her. Once she sprang to her feet as
though struck by a sudden wondrous thought, then,
lifting one arm to the rocky roof, as though it were
some far-off sky, made a mute appeal, moving her lips
as though in prayer. After going through many
seemingly impossible contortions, she put forth her arms
and, twining them that they might resemble the sinuous
movements of a crawling serpent, chanted a weirdly
sweet melody. And all the while this was going on,
the whole audience chanted out, “Whathi! Whathi!”
Though she performed many feats that made those
dusky old men of the front rows lift their chins to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>roof in sheer ecstatic joy, it was her peculiar wardrobe
that mostly appealed to my imagination. Rising to her
feet, she beat her bare thighs with her hands and cried
out as though in pain, her extensive wardrobe rattling
forth the weirdest music imaginable. Her raiment was
adorned with the threaded bones and teeth of dead chiefs,
old men’s beards, maidens’ dried fingers and toes, and,
most sacred of all, the dried bosoms of sacrificed girls!—there
they hung, tied into small bouquets, bits of
tawny skin like shrivelled parchment, grotesque but sad
manuscripts of forgotten lovers, and what sad heartbeats!
For it appeared that they were the breasts of
vestal maidens who had fallen in love and so violated
the principles of their creed. “No! Never!” was my
astonished ejaculation as Kambo, my friendly guide, took
me aside and whispered much to me that must remain
where it remains. As that old friendly chief, Kambo,
pointed out the distinctive charms that adorned the
dancer’s heathen-raiment, I felt like making a bolt for
it. I heartily repented of my foolish act in allowing myself
to be lured into such a den of heathen iniquity. But
it was too late.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Woh, woil! You play moosic, alak!” said Kambo,
as several fierce men approached me. In a moment all
eyes were upon me. Something banged me on the shoulder.
For a moment I lost my head, and fancied that
some mighty heathen god had suddenly dropped from
the roof upon me. In my fright and in the one vital
thought that came to me, I metaphorically leapt over
my own shoulders and endeavoured to bolt down the
tunnel away out into the night; but a nudge in the ribs
with a war-club brought me back to my senses. I was
immediately gripped by twelve pairs of dusky hands and
lifted bodily by the neck and shoulders up on the <i>pae-pae</i>
(stage). In a flash I realized the whole position. Obediently
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>as a child I lifted my violin to my chin and commenced
to play. Only God remembers the melody I
performed; I don’t. A chief chuckled in a blood-curdling
manner as I finished the strain; then he swung a war-club
across the chamber. I instinctively dodged as the
weapon made a boomerang-like swerve and returned to
its owner’s massive palm! Seeing that the aforesaid
act was only an act of appreciation of my playing by
the court jester, I was immensely relieved.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then I took the proffered calabash of kava from the
hands of the head chiefess. All eyes were on me; there
was no way out of it; I saw that I had to drink to the
glory of the dancer’s eyes. My hand trembled, I know,
as I lifted the goblet to my lips and took a sensitive
gulp of that wretched stuff; then I nearly vomited. It
was surely the filthiest liquor ever imbibed by man. I
managed to keep it down, though. It is wonderful what
one can go through when necessity drives! Having read
the lives of the British martyrs, I well knew my chances,
what might occur to me if I did not favour the rites of
those primitive religious bigots; consequently I swallowed
another pint, thinking it best to take no risks of
giving offence.</p>

<p class='c009'>After that trial and dire insult to my digestive apparatus,
I performed another solo, keeping excellent <i>tempo</i>,
considering my position, to the mighty kicks and indescribable
swerves of the heathen houris who were
giving a special ran-tan selection in my honour. The
very coco-nut-oil lamp gleams seemed to fade into a dim
blush as I stared at the monstrous silhouette of myself
that fiddled on the wall. I might say that the cavern
was about fifteen feet high at the end where I stood.
Just as the unearthly din of the audience’s delighted
exclamation was fading away, half a dozen half-caste
girls came running into the cavern out of the tunnel
<span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>entrance. They had coral-dyed hair, and by the fairness
of their complexion I guessed that they were a mixture
of Samoan and Fijian blood. I felt much relieved to see
them appear, for they were human-looking, and so
brought a sense of companionship into that subterranean
den.</p>

<p class='c009'>The oldest member of the new-comers was attractive-looking.
Her eyes were large and very bright. Her
crown of hair had a marvellous glitter about it and fell
in soft ripples down to her shoulders. In another moment
she had rushed up to me and had prostrated herself
at my feet! A tremendous yell from the onlookers followed
this act of the girl’s. It appeared that her act
had made me “taboo”—a sacred personage. I felt bewildered
over it all. An uncomfortable idea got into my
head that I was the chosen for some heathen sacrifice!
I know that I must have visibly paled. I even appreciated
the caresses and wailing lamentations that the
goddess-maid (for such she was) made as she poured
strange phrases into my ears, telling me, doubtless, of
my beauty! I do confess here that her eyes told more
than her lips (for I could not understand the language
in which she flattered me), and I could not fail to understand
the meaning conveyed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Loud acclamations of approval followed all that the
girl did. It was some little time ere I discovered how
I was supposed to show my reciprocation of the dubious
elevation that her choice had conferred upon me. The
fact was that she was the head sacred-maid, and, instead
of choosing a youth of her own race, had chosen me;
therefore I found myself suddenly elevated to priesthood.
The order of priesthood was not so bad, but
I discovered that I was supposed to embrace and kiss
the lips of the monstrous wooden idol that stood on the
<i>pae-pae</i> in front of me. Its big, wooden, grinning, one-toothed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>mouth and goggling glass eyes seemed to say
in some malevolent voice of silence: “Come on, thou
dog of a Christian, kiss this heathenish mouth, bow the
knee to me, thou destroyer of heathen creeds and mighty
wooden images!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I felt helpless. I gazed in despair on the front rows
of that grim, dusky-hued audience of mop-headed men!
They had thrust their chins and clubs forward on seeing
my obvious hesitation to worship that wooden thing.
An ominous silence dwelt over all. Two fierce old hags
put forth their scraggy hands and made as though to
clutch at me, but, warned by a look from the goddess-maid
who had brought me to that pass, they lifted their
chins and spat at me! And still I hesitated. I would
die sooner than kneel before that grinning wooden deity.
By now the audience was loudly shouting, their headdress
of big red feathers violently shaking, and still I
pretended not to understand what they wished me to do.
But it was hopeless, for they kept shouting and pointing
to the maid and then at the idol. There stood that wooden
thing, mocking me with its hideous carven grin. Not
even though it meant death for me, would I violate my
inherent dignity by embracing that monstrous image.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Woi! Woi!” I cried, and, pretending to misunderstand
the whole business, I leapt forward and embraced
the maid.</p>

<p class='c009'>Those old chiefs opened their mouths in astonishment.
That much I noticed as I instinctively turned my head
to see the effect of my act. The very tattoo engraving
that adorned the faces of the aged priests had wrinkled
up into distorted bunches. In another moment each
look of rage and horror had resolved into a grim grimace—they
were all grinning. I was saved! The Fijian
race was endowed with humour! No words of mine
can adequately describe all I felt at that moment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>My relief was intense. I knew that, had those priests
been as humourless as are British disciples in their creeds,
I had been done for. God knows, my head, that now
recalls those old days, would have decorated a Fijian’s
girdle, or would be a pinch of dust beneath the South
Sea palms, or possibly have been discovered ornamenting
a native hut, and by now be on show, exhibited in some
British anthropological museum, as a fine specimen of
the skull of primitive man.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the maid continued to rub my face with her soft
nose (the customary salutation of the Fijians), I felt
much relieved.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Awaie, le oa taki!” she murmured.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then, in response to the wish of that subterranean
audience, I placed my violin to my chin and commenced
to play a weird chant to her eyes. It had to be done,
I knew. Ah, how I played! My instrument wailed out
Wagner’s “Swan Song,” then I finished up with a Band
of Hope hymn. And all the while the maid fawned on
me like a cat, looked into my eyes, stroked my hand
that swayed the violin bow, and gazed in wonder on the
other that travelled up and down the fingerboard of
my instrument.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly I seemed to be whirled away on the roar
and thunder of some invisible Niagara Falls. Forked
lightning seemed to flicker down the corridors of my
brain. I knew that it was the fumes of that cursed
kava beginning to work on the emotional temperament!
The world seemed to wobble on its orbit. I made a
creditable effort, I am sure, to steady myself; then I
seemed to have leapt out of myself—I had clutched the
maid, and in some awful delirium of ecstasy was whirling
with her in the heathenish mekee-dance!</p>

<p class='c009'>I may not tell all that occurred at that enforced professional
engagement, no, not till Time has finished its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>onward flight and the blind sun stares on the melancholy
past. One thing I can confess to, and that is, I had
made up my mind to escape at the first opportunity.
Opposite me was the tunnel-way wherethrough I had
entered. Often, as the clamouring audience rose to
encore the dancers, their shadows fell on me and across
the cavern walls; but my chance seemed never to arrive.
Still I played on and watched, and still the maid whom
I had embraced sang a weird melody of wailful sweetness
into my ears.</p>

<p class='c009'>Once more I was compelled to imbibe the “sacred”
potion of kava, and once more my digestive apparatus
groaned within me.</p>

<p class='c009'>I thought I must surely be dreaming when all the
fierce, watching eyes of the priests, who stared at the
goddess-maid and myself, suddenly dropped from their
sockets and twinkled on the cavern’s floor! This strange
effect was caused, not only through some obliquity of
my kava-stricken vision, but also because a puff of wind
suddenly blew down the tunnel-way’s entrance and
swayed the rows of coco-nut-oil lamps into shadowy
gleams. As soon as normal conditions returned, my
senses seemed to readjust themselves.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly the sacred personage, Kasawayo, who had
stood aside since I had been made taboo, stepped forward
and cried: “Alaka!” (Hold!)</p>

<p class='c009'>This act of Kasawayo’s gave me considerable relief.
I saw that she had some great influence over the priests;
for they immediately ceased their hubbub and their remarks,
I am sure, of a debased nature.</p>

<p class='c009'>It appeared that Kasawayo was the religious impersonation
of some great goddess of shadowland, and I
had reason to believe that she was a jealous impersonation.
Stepping on the small platform, she gave the
maid who had made me taboo a fierce whack on the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>face! A great hullabaloo followed this ungracious act.
The priests, chiefesses, and youths leapt from their mats
and joined enthusiastically in the mêlée. My chance
to escape had come! In a second I had dived towards
the cavern’s side. I scrambled down the tunnel-way.
When I arrived at the spot where one was compelled
to stoop, a great fear seized my heart, for I heard the
sound of breathing just behind me—I knew that I was
pursued! I cursed my ample bulk. Had I been a little
thinner I could have squeezed through the narrow aperture
easily enough. Holding my violin forward in one
hand, so that I could clear the walls without its being
crushed, I gave a final wriggle—I was through!</p>

<p class='c009'>My delight can be imagined when I emerged into the
bush of the surrounding gullies. Scrambling through
the tropical growth I heard a faint shuffling noise close
behind me. It was evident that someone else had rushed
through the tunnel-way and was close on my track.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m done for!” I thought, as I turned round, determined
to sell my life dearly. The old barbarian that
dwells in all men leapt into my soul. I even felt some
fierce joy at the idea of cracking my pursuer’s skull ere
I fell. “Come on!” I shouted, as I held a lump of
rock over my head; then I dropped my clumsy weapon
and smiled—the dusky goddess-maid who had made me
taboo stood before me!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, Papalagi!” she whispered, as she clutched
my arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>Like an obedient child I raced along as she ran soft-footed
beside me. I felt that I was running across some
fairy-world in a dream, as I saw the maid’s flying heels
and the moonlit forest around me.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Runner fast!” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>And so I did.</p>

<p class='c009'>Arriving at the bottom of the steep incline, we pulled
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>up by the edge of a wide mountain lagoon. Feathery
palms leaned over the silent waters. The moon, high
in the sky right overhead, was imaged distinctly in the
dark water at my feet, and by the mirrored orb floated
a canoe. The clear shadow of that tiny craft was so
distinct that it seemed to float just <i>over</i> the moon’s image,
the shadow being more visible than the canoe itself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“O Papalagi, jumper! jumper!” said the maid in an
appealing voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>I did not hesitate, but I leaned forward and leapt—splash!—I
had jumped into the shadow craft and down
into the depths of the imaged moon. The maid, as I
floundered about in the deep water, clutched my hair,
and so enabled me to scramble up on the lagoon’s edge.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Silly Papalagi!” she murmured; then we heard the
wild calls of our pursuers coming from somewhere up
in the mountains. In a moment I had leapt again, this
time landing safely in the real article. The way that
girl paddled the canoe is something that pleases my
memory to this day. She looked like some pretty enchantress
as she sat there in front of me, her paddle
cutting a line of fire as she dipped softly into the radiance
of the moon’s white flame. So clear were those huddled
waters from the distant mountains, that we could see
ourselves sitting in the canoe as it sped across the dark
depths. I felt a thrill of joy as we gently beached on the
opposite shore. The girl leapt softly from the canoe;
as for me, I upset the fragile craft and then scrambled
knee-deep ashore. My little comrade was evidently taking
no risks that night.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Comer on!” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>It took me all my time to keep up with her as she
raced down into the hollows and sped up the steep inclines.
There seemed no ending to that forest, ere we
rushed out from the shades of the breadfruits and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>found myself in a large, cleared space that fronted a
native village!</p>

<p class='c009'>Even then I did not feel easy in my mind. But I was
relieved when the girl told me that it was her own village.
The hushed, huddled, bee-hive-shaped dens in the shade
of the palms, through which the saluting moonlight fell,
made a picturesque scene.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it safe?” I said, as I stared at the rows of huts.</p>

<p class='c009'>The little goddess-maid answered me by turning a
somersault on the <i>rara</i> (village green) right in front of
my eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Fanga Loma, for that turned out to be her name,
ran across the green patch and entered one of the larger
huts.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Supposing she’s a traitor?” I thought, as the girl
disappeared.</p>

<p class='c009'>But she was straight enough. In a few moments I
heard sleepy mutterings, and then a loud jabbering commenced.
In a few moments Fanga Loma’s parents, for
such they were, had hastily arrayed themselves in their
fig-leaves, so to speak, and had run out of the hut to see
and welcome me! For a considerable time Fanga continued
to jabber in her own tongue to her people. I
could only guess the lies she was telling them as she
pointed excitedly to me and then gabbled again. She was
a clever little devil, for the pleased expression on the
faces of her aged parents was a treat to see. I suppose
she had to invent some kind of a tale. The village
was a Christianized one, and had Fanga told the truth
her parents would probably have been greatly incensed
at finding that she visited the heathen Kai Tholos of
the mountains. Though it was midnight, a festival
was immediately given in my honour. From the innumerable
grunts of pleasure and the attention which was
lavished upon me, I gathered that I was supposed to have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>rescued Fanga Loma from some dire danger. As for
Fanga, She gave me many fascinating glances of confidence,
and seemed quite assured that I was not the kind
to go back on her and tell the truth! She had evidently
met white men before, and so knew what holy beggars
they were!</p>

<p class='c009'>Sleepy youths and women dodged about as they lit
up the hanging coco-nut-oil lamps that are to be seen
in all native villages. In a few moments they were all
alight, and the breadfruit and banyan boughs looked like
the branches of some fairy scene. I knew what was
expected of me, and so I took up my position beneath
the centre palm tree and, placing my violin to my chin,
commenced to play. Possibly I looked like some
wondrous heathen god pulling invisible strings—strings
that guided the wonderful capers of those semi-heathen
people. Up and down they jumped, the whole population
bobbing like puppets as I fiddled away! The little
kiddies awoke from their sleeping-mats and rushed out
of the huts to see the fun. To see a white man playing
a strange instrument under a palm by moonlight was
something that made the kids stare in wonder. They
looked like dusky cherubs as they crept on all-fours
among the leafy banyan groves, and peered at me
between the fern and palm-leaves in fright. Such
demon-bright eyes they had! And when I whipped out
the flute-like harmonics of Paganini’s “Witches’
Dance,” they all gave a shriek of terror, let the big palm-leaf
drop, and vanished, as it were, into shadowland!</p>

<p class='c009'>After playing for a considerable time, I stopped, and
intimated to the chiefs that I wished to get away. At
first they begged me to stay; but, seeing that I was
determined, they loaded me with coco-nut milk. One
old woman took a large bone hair-comb from her mop and
presented it to me. After a little discussion they agreed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>to let Fanga Loma accompany me a little way on the
route. I was glad of this gracious act, for I felt a
bit nervous that night. And so off Fanga Loma and I
went. I heard the death-owl screaming as we entered
the deep shadows of the forest. Fanga began to sing
a pretty strain as her bare feet shuffled a kind of <i>tempo</i>
to her melody while she walked beside me. I felt like
a heathen as the moonlight streamed through the giant
trees and that strange girl stared up into my eyes. Those
eyes of hers were unearthly bright, and seemed to express
the wild, poetic mystery of her race. She cast a weird
atmosphere over everything by her eerie presence. The
trees around me, the moonlight on the tropic flowers, the
stealing streams, and the stars, seemed charged with the
magical light of Fanga Loma’s eyes! I’ve often
fancied I’ve felt the mystery of the great Unseen that
dwells about us as we move through this mortal existence,
and such a feeling of the proximity of the unknown and
“worlds not realized” came to me that night. That
eerie, star-eyed girl seemed some enchantress, some dusky
Christabel haunting my footsteps as I softly trod the
mossy path of that moonlit forest. It was a bewitching
melody that she sang as she softly swayed in an elfin-like
manner beside me.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For Heaven’s sake don’t sing that!” I whispered,
as I looked into her face.</p>

<p class='c009'>And did she stop?—not she! She simply sang on all
the more, then looked up into my eyes. I trembled; a
fierce light shone in those unearthly bright orbs.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why you leaver go my arm?” she wailed; then
she said softly: “Papalagi, must you go and leaver
Fanga Loma for ever?”</p>

<p class='c009'>We were standing by the cross-road of the forest as
she said that. The girl’s manner and the eerie gaze of
her eyes carried me out of myself back into some other
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>age. I realized my weakness, and turned away from
those shining, appealing eyes. I kissed the hand she
offered, and gazed as though in deep thought on the
floor of the silent forest.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Fanga, I <i>must</i> go back to Suva, but I will return
some day,” I whispered, as I looked in fright on the
giant trees, wondering if they could hear!</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the girl fell on her knees, lifted her hands to the
forest height, and cried out in this wise:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is not the world of love, the magic of the stars,
flowers, and deep waters and touch of a maiden’s lips
enough for such as you? Are not these trees that sigh
over us our dear, great friends, and yours too, O white
Papalagi? Who is this great white god that seems
sweeter to you than the loving arms of a maid? Hear
me, I am daughter of great chief. The village will be
your own, chiefs will fawn at your feet and cast nicer
fruits and shells at you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment I marvelled at the maid’s sudden outburst.
I wondered if she had been reading some South
Sea novel, so strangely romantic did it all seem.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will come again, Loma,” I murmured, as I recovered
my senses and gazed steadily into the eyes of that wild
girl of the forest. She was little more than a child;
many acts of hers had told me that much.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Farewell, little goddess-maid!” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Farewell, O Papalagi!” she whispered, then she
gave a jump and—splash! had dived headlong into the
lagoon by our side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“God, she’s committed suicide!” I thought, as I made
to leap into the dark water. I could see only a few
ripples where she had disappeared. I put forth my hands
to dive, then stopped, for out in the middle of the lagoon
up came a tangled mass of hair! It was Fanga’s head. I
saw her swimming arms and dusky shoulders twinkle in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>the moonlight. She was simply swimming across the
lagoon, taking the nearest cut back to her native village!</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c009'>When I awoke in my Suva lodging-house next morning,
I discovered that my violin was cracked. But for the
scratches on my legs and the wisps of hair from dead
men’s grey beards clinging to my blue serge suit, I
might have concluded that the whole of my night’s adventures
were the outcome of a nightmare. About a week
after my adventure in that heathen monastery and with
Fanga Loma, I met a chief who claimed to be the son
of King Thakombau. He was an intelligent man, and
told me a lot about the doings of the old cannibalistic
times. When I told him what I had experienced in the
heathen monastery of the Kai Tholos, he gave me a hint
as to what might have happened to me had I not made
my escape. It was this son of Thakombau’s who told me
many interesting heathen legends. One legend in particular
struck my imagination, for it was about the old goddess
Kasawayo, but was so different from the impersonation
I had seen in the Kai Tholos temple, that I will
do my best to give an impression of all that I heard in
the following chapter.</p>

<div class='nf-center c004'>
    <div>(A FIJIAN LEGEND FOR YOUNG AND OLD CHILDREN)</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c026'>A Goddess in the Garb of Mortality—A Garden of Eden—Temptation—Kasawayo
and Kora the Mortal—The
Battle—Flight to Shadowland.</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_45_0_65 c008'>AGES ago a goddess of shadowland sickened of the
sacred halls of the passionless gods. One day a
great desire to be a mortal entered her heart, for she
had once been a mortal herself and had had the desires
of mortality, but knew it not. She was sitting by her
cavern door, gazing across the starlit singing seas of
paradise, when she made up her mind to desert shadowland.</p>

<p class='c009'>“My heart is lonely enough; I long for warm lips
that will kiss my face and eyes and give unto my soul
those impassioned tendernesses that I so strangely remember
in my dreams,” she cried, as she listened to the
moaning of the waves and sighing forest trees of shadowland.
“Why, why should I sit here weeping, listening,
for thousands of moons, and none to touch my lips?”
So thought the goddess as she put her fingers up and
softly twirled the skeins of tangled sunset that adorned
her hair. Having made up her mind, she at once went
off and consulted the oracles (who were the great dead
chiefs of Fiji). Listening eagerly to them, she at once
followed their advice, and so started to travel across the
wonderful mountains of Mbula. It was in the great
mountains of Mbula where she could kneel at the altar
and feet of the great god Ndengi, who was the Supreme-Giver
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>of shadowland. After travelling a long way,
Kasawayo (for that was the goddess’s name) came to
the entrance of a cavern in the mountain’s side. As she
approached the entrance, a beautiful light streamed out
upon her. She gazed round, and heard the tramp of
the vassal gods who were passing across the outer plains.
They were going off, she knew, to hang the stars and
moons and fleecy clouds up in the sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>On seeing the mighty heathen gods travelling along
by the light of their own eyes—eyes that stared like
beautiful moons across the plains—Kasawayo knew she
had arrived at the wonderful halls wherein dwelt Ndengi.
Prostrating herself before the sentinel gods (for such
they were who stood for ever watching by the great
hollow of the doorway where she stood), she said: “I
am Kasawayo, the goddess of half-remembered dreams,
and it is my wish to enter the mighty halls of Mbula.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The taller sentinel, who stood as high as a mountain,
and who was busy tattooing the sky with stars, dropped
his mighty calabash that was full of the dead hopes of
human dreams, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Vanaka! O Le Su Kasawayo.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In another moment Kasawayo had entered the doorway
of the underworld, and was travelling along a track
that had mighty mountains on each side. Looking upward
she saw the spirits of the dead flying ahead of
her, on the way to the wrathful Ndengi to be judged for
their sins on the great living world.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Vanaka!” she cried, waving her hand as the sorrowing
souls passed right overhead. Death had reshaped
them into beautiful bird-like things that had the faces
of handsome youths. Kasawayo sighed as their glimmering
wings flitted beneath the stars that shone over the
mountain peaks; then they passed from her sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kasawayo felt very sad and weary when she at last
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>arrived before the vast <i>pae-pae</i> (throne) whereon sat
the great god Ndengi. Across the roof of the underworld
shone a myriad stars, and many moons sent wistful
gleams across the mysterious forest regions of Spiritland.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kasawayo trembled as she approached the vast <i>pae-pae</i>.
A stream of green light fell slantwise through the
branches of the giant palms that leaned over the god’s
throne, sending wistful gleams down on the small form
of the ambitious goddess. As the moonbeams trickled
over her tresses that fell in a shining cataract down to
her bare feet, she said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“O great Ndengi, I have travelled far, for I wish to
go down the skies and live on the isles of Fiji.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Ndengi spoke, and his voice sounded like the
far-off muttering of thunder in the mountains:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will let you go down over the waters of the sunsets,
but ere you go I must turn you into a bird.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At hearing that she would be turned into a bird that
could so easily fly to the homes of mortal men, Kasawayo
was delighted, and at once fell on her knees before
Ndengi and sang a prayer in this wise:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh, great Ndengi, God of Mbau,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>My heart murmurs, full of love for you;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And the flowers and foaming rivers of shadowland</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Are singing of the splendours of Ndengi.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>The beauty of your wandering thoughts, the stars,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Sing passionless in the hollow of your hand,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Telling of your love for mighty things.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Then she gazed up softly in the great god’s eyes, and
whispered in a frightened way:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“I am a woman of half-remembered dreams,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Where forests sigh above the stealing streams,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And so I long to gaze in warm, wild eyes</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Of men where Passion in her sorrow sighs.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>Like a great wind was the sigh of Ndengi as Kasawayo
ceased her sweet song. Then he said: “Arise!” and
the goddess rose to her feet and stumbled on her thin
legs, for she had been turned into a great bird! Her
eyes were still beautiful and sparkled like unto the stars.
Her wings were tipped with gold and striped with deep
crimson and green, her breast was as snowy white as the
orange blossom. Ndengi leaned against the mountains
that were pillars of his throne, and, gazing on the transformed
Kasawayo, said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have disguised you so that no mortal will dare to
love you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kasawayo, on hearing this, smiled in her heart as she
stared in Ndengi’s great mirror, a lagoon that imaged
him as he sat on his throne. She saw that she had a
woman’s eyes, and she knew what a woman’s eyes could
do. Then, down the mountain’s paths and across the
valleys of Mbau, the goddesses came running, for they
had heard the echoes, and would wish Kasawayo good-bye
ere she left shadowland.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Vanaka! Le tao. O Kasawayo, you look beautiful,
though you are a bird.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kasawayo lifted her eyes in her vanity and saw her
own image reflected in Ndengi’s great eyes! “He warns
me!” she muttered.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Kasawayo spread her new wings, and without
a moment’s hesitation flew off into the starlit, silent night.
Often her wings brushed against the soft light of the
stars as she curved in her downward flight ere she came
to the Fijian Isles, which she had seen in dreams and
heard about from sinful spirits. She was well pleased
as she fluttered over the breadfruit trees that grow in
such abundance near Nadronga on the isle of Viti Levu.
Sitting on the topmost bough of a tall coco-palm, she
gazed down, and stared curiously on a flock of Fijian
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>children who were romping in the drala-weed and deep
fern of the forest floor. The sight of those children
awakened strange old memories in her mind. Looking
down in a sidelong look, as a bird must look, she said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Children of the forest, I am the goddess Kasawayo,
and have come from shadowland to watch over you all!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The children gazed in surprise as they looked up and
saw a wonderful bird with a human face speaking to
them from the topmost bough of the coco-nut palm.
Then they all shouted back to the goddess:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Are you Kasawayo, she of whom the great chiefs of
our village so often talk and pray about?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then a fierce-looking boy looked up and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You’ve caused a lot of sorrow in our hut, you have.
Why didn’t you hear my mother’s prayers?”</p>

<p class='c009'>But Kasawayo only flapped her wings, and gazed down
on the children in sorrow. At this moment a serpent
crawled out of the thick bamboo bush hard by the swampy
lagoon. It had a long, crimson-hued neck that soared
upwards and fell as it crawled, like the neck of a <i>lika-bird</i>
(swan). On seeing the children it at once stood erect
on its twisted tail, and hissed forth:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Children, what are you talking to up in that tree?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“We are talking to a bird, O god of the shore caves,”
said the children, as they all pointed up into the coco-palm.</p>

<p class='c009'>The serpent, who was a disguised god, looked curiously
up into the coco-palm, and then said in a soft, insinuating
way:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Kasawayo!—it’s you!” Then it added:
“Why, I never thought to see you down here after all
these thousands of years!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, it’s I, right enough; Ndengi let me come down
and see you all for a while.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Did he?” responded the serpent.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>Kasawayo felt a bit worried as she looked sideways
down at the serpent. Then, feeling it would be best to
be quite pleasant, she said as she gave a coquettish
glance:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am pleased to see you again, but what I really
wish to see is a handsome Fijian youth who will love me
and return with me to the halls of Mbau.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“You do, do you?” thought the serpent-god as it
looked up at Kasawayo, a crafty, envious gleam in its
big green eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kasawayo, who now had a woman’s instincts, trembled
slightly as she noticed that look. Then she said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know you’ll help me to find a handsome, passionate
mortal, won’t you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The serpent-god swelled to double his size, and, looking
up at Kasawayo, thought to himself:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, I like the look of you myself, and I can be a
passionate lover if I like.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Being a wary serpent-god, he took care that Kasawayo
should have no inkling of his thoughts. Then he unrolled
his spotted body so that he might reveal his vivid
colours to the best advantage. Having shown his beauty,
he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kasawayo, I will do my best to find you a handsome
lover.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Vanaka! O serpent-god,” quoth Kasawayo, as she
spread her wings that the serpent might see that she was
as well-coloured as he was. In another moment she had
bravely fluttered down to the forest floor.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Alow! Woi!” cried the wondering children, as
Kasawayo stood beside the hot-eyed serpent.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Run away, children!” said the artful serpent-god.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a moment the children had all vanished, were running
home to the village to tell their parents all they
had seen.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>Turning to Kasawayo, the serpent-god said in his
gentlest voice:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on!”</p>

<p class='c009'>And so Kasawayo with a trembling heart went away
through the forest, walking by the side of the crawling
serpent-god whose heart was bitter indeed to think he
was not disguised by the fates as a handsome youth
instead of an ugly serpent-thing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sing to me,” said the god, as he glided by Kasawayo’s
side.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kasawayo at once lifted her half-bird, half-human
face, and sang.</p>

<p class='c009'>And, while the serpent-god was flattering Kasawayo
and giving artful hints, a handsome native youth suddenly
emerged from the forest shadows and stood before
them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A youth—the very one!” exclaimed the goddess.</p>

<p class='c009'>On hearing Kasawayo’s unguarded exclamation, the
god got into a great rage and cursed himself for asking
the goddess to sing. For it was the sweet voice of the
goddess that had attracted the handsome youth as he
lay dreaming under the coco-palms.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now this youth’s name was Kora, and Kora was a
passionate youth. The serpent-god noticed the look of
admiration that leapt into the youth’s eyes as he stood
before them.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I must get rid of him,” thought the god, as he looked
up into Kora’s face and said in a very deceitful
voice:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kora, how very pleased I really am to see you at
this moment. What do you think of this beautiful bird
that is here by my side?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Saying this, the serpent, without waiting to hear Kora’s
opinion, took hold of the bird’s wing and introduced her
to Kora.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>As Kasawayo’s eyes sparkled with delight and the
handsome youth bowed and kissed her tenderly on the
face, the jealous serpent said quickly:</p>

<p class='c009'>“See, Kora, ’tis but a bird, and for all its beauty is
only fit for flying.”</p>

<p class='c009'>But, nevertheless, the kiss that Kora gave the bird
was so unduly prolonged, and was so passionate, that
the disguised goddess hung her head and blushed up to
the soft feathers that adorned her brow! The jealous
serpent perceiving this, and seeing that Kora was already
in love with Kasawayo, looked up and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Go away, Kora; Kasawayo is my guest. To-night
she goes back again to shadowland, so I have little time
with her.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ho! ho!” said Kora; “so you want her all for yourself,
do you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Saying this, Kora stared defiantly at the serpent.</p>

<p class='c009'>Without any more ado, the serpent seized hold of the
frightened Kasawayo and started off into the deeper
shadows of the forest.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a moment Kora sprang forward, saying:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You shall not take her away from me; well enough
I can see that she loves me, and not you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Kora lifted his big war-club and made a desperate
attack on the serpent. In a moment the serpent had
lifted its hideous head and chanted forth, “Wathi, wathi,
noko-buli!” As the sad Kora heard those words, he
realized that the serpent was a heathen god. He knew
well enough that he had no power to thwart the serpent’s
wishes and so save Kasawayo.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the serpent once more seized hold of the goddess,
she looked over her shoulder and gazed into the eyes of
Kora as much as to say, “O beautiful Kora, I love you.
Yet must I go away into the forest with this terrible
serpent-god.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Kora hung his head for shame to think that a serpent
had more power than he had.</p>

<p class='c009'>When the god came to his dwelling-cave, which was
by the sea, he pulled Kasawayo hurriedly into the dark
beyond the big doorway. This great cave was lit up
by a dim light that was emitted from the eyes of the
serpent. Dragging Kasawayo over to the far corner
he placed the trembling goddess on a large lump of red
coral that was carved into a chair. As she sat there,
couched in the moonlight that crept through the doorway,
she trembled violently, and gazed despairingly on
the serpent. It was then that the serpent-god crawled
to the far end of the big cavern, and, raising his head
till it touched the crystals of the sparkling roof, said,
“Wathi, wathi!” and lo, the serpent was no longer a
serpent, but stood there before Kasawayo—a handsome
god!</p>

<p class='c009'>Kasawayo said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Though you are now turned into a handsome god,
still I do not like you. You do not look as beautiful
as the Fijian youth, Kora.”</p>

<p class='c009'>On hearing this, the god got into a terrible rage.
Then, quickly cooling down, he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you will only love me, I will let you walk through
the forest by night in your own shape, for, though
you are beautiful, you are not as lovely as you were
when you had a woman’s form in Mbau. Now will
you love me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment Kasawayo sat couched in the moonshine,
thinking over what the god Buli-buli had said.
Then she looked up into his glistening serpent-like eyes,
and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am in your power, so I will do my best to please
and love you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Immediately the god heard Kasawayo say this, he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>said in a terrible voice that echoed through the hollow
cavern:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wathi! wathi!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Before the echoes had faded away Kasawayo stood
shining in the moonshine. She was once more transformed
back into a beautiful goddess.</p>

<p class='c009'>Being a heathen serpent-god, and having none of the
passions of the mortals, Buli-buli simply gazed upon
Kasawayo, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now that I have made you a goddess again, you
must sit here in this cavern and sing to me all through
the day and all through the night.”</p>

<p class='c009'>And so for many days and nights Kasawayo sang
and sang till her throat was tired. At length her heart
began to long for the voice of Kora, and her eyes for
one sight of his beauty.</p>

<p class='c009'>One evening, as the sun was setting, she said to the
god Buli-buli, who was at that moment dozing by the
cavern’s door:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, I am so tired of singing away in this cave;
though I love you, Buli-buli, still I feel that I would like
to go out into the forest by night alone.”</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment the god looked at Kasawayo, growled,
and then said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“If you go out into the forest alone, I shall be turned
into a serpent again till you come back; and, were you
to be unfaithful to me by allowing the lips of a mortal
to touch your own, I should be doomed to remain ever
in the shape of a serpent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Saying this, the god looked fiercely at Kasawayo, as
though he would read her soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kasawayo, being a true Fijian goddess-woman, put
her most innocent look into her bright eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the god continued:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now, will you promise me that, if I let you go out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>into the forest alone, you will be faithful and return
again?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh yes, I promise faithfully that I will be true to
you and return to the cave again.” Saying this,
Kasawayo’s heart beat violently with joy at the thought
that she might meet the handsome Kora once more.</p>

<p class='c009'>Buli-buli looked up into her face for a long while,
then said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The sun has dipped his head into the <i>moani aili</i>
(ocean); the stars are marching across the plains of
shadowland; go, Kasawayo, into the forest alone!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kasawayo jumped to her feet, delight shining in her
dark eyes. As she passed out of the cavern, she looked
over her shoulder to bid farewell to the god, but she
only saw a huge serpent crawling on its spotted belly
across the floor of the cave.</p>

<p class='c009'>Directly she arrived outside the cavern she ran away
at full speed into the moonlit forest. She was indeed
beautiful to look upon. Her hair hung in thick, curling
tresses down to her smooth brown back, and often got
entangled in her soft feet as she ran. A girdle of sweet-scented
flowers swathed her loins. As she ran along,
the forest winds put out their spirit fingers, lifted her
masses of hair tenderly, and looked at her beautiful
form; and the moo-moo flowers scented her body as
she brushed past. Coming to the hollows, where grew
the taro and the fruits of the mortals, she turned aside
and went inland. For she heard the laughter of the
little mortal children in the villages and the sounds of
drums beating. Her heart fluttered as she heard those
mortal noises, and knew that the forest high chiefs were
worshipping their Meke idols beneath the big crimson
blossoms of the ndrala-trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Tani! Vanaka! O Le saka!” were the words that
came to her ears like echoes of some far-away memory.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>A great longing came to her soul. She felt that she
would love to go into the village that was just by and
look upon the faces of the mortals. But she stifled the
feeling, for had she not promised the god Buli-buli to
keep away from them?</p>

<p class='c009'>She had not gone far down the little track that led
away from the native village, when she came to a moonlit
space that was just by a forest lagoon. She knew not
why it was, but her heart beat rapidly as she crept nearer
and nearer. And no wonder, for there, sitting on a
mossy stump of a dead breadfruit tree, with head bowed
with grief, was Kora.</p>

<p class='c009'>Lifting the big palm-leaves that brushed against her
face, Kasawayo gazed on the weeping youth with loving
eyes. Then in her sweetest accents she commenced to
sing this song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh, love of my life, like unto the stars</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And the winds and the waving trees,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And the singing pines by the coral bars,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Loud with the voices of roaming seas,</div>
      <div class='line in1'>You are to me, you are to me!”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Kora slowly raised his head. For a moment he gazed
like one who still thought that he dreamed. The <i>O Le
maun oa</i> (nightingale) ceased to sing in the backa trees
just overhead, so delicious was the warm-throated melody
that Kasawayo sang. Then Kora started up to his feet.
He realized that some beautiful goddess was singing to
him. He knew well that no one but his lost Kasawayo
would have so beautiful a voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>Still the goddess sang on. And as she sang she
thought of the serpent-god who had, for her sake, been
transformed into a serpent so that she might go into
the forest alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>She longed to rush forth from the bamboos and reveal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>herself to Kora. But how could she do so when
she had promised the serpent-god to be faithful to him?
So she still remained hidden, and sang on.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kora listened to her voice with delight. Then he
cried out:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kasawayo! I know ’tis you who sing; come forth
and let me see you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>On hearing the voice of the youth calling her, so
strong was her love that she almost rushed forward.
For a moment she controlled the awful impulse, and
started to sing once more, and these were the words of
her song:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh, Kora, my beloved, your eyes are like the moo-moo flowers;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Your form is as straight as a young coco-palm.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>So my heart, my heart is on fire with thoughts of love;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Yet I dare not reveal the beauty of my face to you;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>For, oh, listen to me! I have made a vow to the serpent-god;</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And I must not reveal my beautiful face to your sweeter eyes.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Oh, Kora, my heart is heavy with grief; what shall I do?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Then Kora also made up a song; and the words of the
song were like unto this:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Oh, come to me, my Kasawayo, for my heart is full of joy.</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Vinaka! O loved one, all praise to Mbete and the great Ndengi of Mbau</div>
      <div class='line in1'>To think that you love me—oh, to think that you love me!</div>
      <div class='line in1'>And oh, Kasawayo, if two people love, who shall deny them?</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Cannot I see thy face, look into thine eyes, and love thy form, Kasawayo?”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Then Kasawayo answered in this wise:</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I show you my face, will you promise not to kiss
 me, or say those beautiful words of love that I would
 so love to hear you say? For, Kora, dear one, I am
 a goddess, and, though I have a heart that feels some
 of the passions of the mortals, it is sinful that I should
 love a mortal.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>Saying this, Kasawayo looked about her, and whispered
through the silence of the bushes:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hush, Kora, listen. The serpent-god may be able
to know what I am doing, though his eyes be far away!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“O Kasawayo, I promise to do as you wish,” responded
the handsome youth.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then Kora commenced to sing his beautiful song, as
with complete trust Kasawayo stepped forth from the
bamboo trees and stood before the youth in all her loveliness!</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment the young chief Kora placed his hands
over his eyes. The beauty of Kasawayo was so dazzling
that he dared not gaze upon her without wanting to
embrace her. At length, feeling that he could withstand
the temptation of her sight without risk, he uncovered
his eyes. Then the youth and the goddess gazed
upon each other in perfect stillness as though they were
perfect figures of cold carven stone, so entranced were
they with the sight of each other’s beauty.</p>

<p class='c009'>The goddess was the first to break the silence. With
all the sweet frailness that is born of woman, she, notwithstanding
that she was a goddess, put forth her beautiful
face and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“O Kora mine, let us each close our eyes, and then,
inclining our forms one towards the other, imagine that
we are lovers kissing.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kora replied:</p>

<p class='c009'>“O Kasawayo, I will do this that you ask of me, but
still am I sad to think that the meeting of our lips is
only to be imagined. For we mortals love to feel the
beauty of the maiden that we love; for, though the
imagination is always more beautiful than the reality,
still we love the beauty and sorrow that we see more
than the heaven that we imagine.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Saying this, Kora sighed and closed his eyes. Bending
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>forward, he stretched out his hands, and then, kissing
the air fondly with his impassioned lips, tried to imagine
that he held the beautiful Kasawayo in his arms.</p>

<p class='c009'>And Kasawayo the spirit-woman?—she did likewise.
Only for a few moments did they both stand wrapt in
the ecstasy of their imagination. The forest winds sighed
amorously through the branches of the ndralas, kissing
Kasawayo’s shining tresses that hung around her like a
tent as her form inclined towards Kora. Then, lo!
the magic fingers of the winds, that were caressing
Kasawayo’s tresses, accidentally brushed them against
the bare knees of the inclining, impassioned Kora! At
this the young chief, through the ecstatic joy of his feelings,
lost his balance and, stumbling over a little twig,
fell forward into the outstretched arms of Kasawayo!</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment their lips met in a passionate kiss;
their eyes, out of which shone the light of their love,
gazed fondly upon each other.</p>

<p class='c009'>The travelling fingers of the winds wailed a tender,
love-like <i>adagio</i> across the night’s brooding harp of
mighty forest trees. Suddenly Kasawayo’s lips gave
forth a scream. Alas! she had remembered her promise
to the serpent-god.</p>

<p class='c009'>As remembrance came to her, her arms, that were
still folded round the handsome Kora in a fond embrace,
shrivelled up, lo!—changed into a bird’s wings.</p>

<p class='c009'>The serpent-god, far away in his cave, knew what
Kasawayo was doing! Full of jealousy and hate, he
waited for the lovers to kiss again. But Kasawayo,
who also knew the magic of seeing and knowing things
that were far away, looked up into Kora’s eyes and said:
“O my Kora, kiss me not again; should you do so,
the serpent will be able to turn my body, that you so
love, into that of a bird.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Directly Kora heard the scream and felt the rustle
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>of the feathery wings about his shoulders, he stepped
apart. Looking into Kasawayo’s eyes, he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will do as you wish, nor would the thing have
happened but for the interference of the winds and the
twig of the ndrala-bush. But still it matters not; we
will thwart the serpent-god’s spite. You are still very
beautiful, though your arms have changed into the wings
of a bird.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As Kora whispered this into her ears, Kasawayo
ceased weeping, gazed up into his eyes, and murmured:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Am I really as lovely as I was before I had these
wings?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Saying this, Kasawayo spread out the wings, and in
doing so revealed the topmost curves of her bosom to
Kora’s eyes. So exquisite was the sight to the youth,
that in a moment of forgetfulness he stepped forward
to kiss her once again on her lips and so assure her of
his love.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kasawayo, seeing the brightness of his eyes, and guessing
that which he was about to do, ran backwards a
few steps. Putting her wings out, she cried:</p>

<p class='c009'>“O Kora, kiss me not, for if you do I shall lose these
limbs that you have touched and told me are so
beautiful!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kora, in the distraction of not being able to fold her
in his arms and kiss her lips, placed his hand to his
eyes and stared across the moonlit forest in deep thought.
Then, turning to Kasawayo, he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where is this terrible serpent-god? I am determined
to have your love and kisses. I will go and kill
the serpent.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Saying this, Kora drew his stalwart form up to its
full height, and, taking hold of his big war-club, swung
it around his handsome head three times! Kasawayo,
who possessed all the beautiful cunning that mortal
<span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>woman reveals when she would protect the one she loves,
gazed upon the youth with thoughtful eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kora, my beloved, you are only a mortal; and,
though I know well that you are brave and strong, still
my heart is heavy at the thought of your meeting the
serpent-god in combat.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Side by side the lovers walked through the forest
and said not a word to each other. Kasawayo, who
longed to feel Kora’s arms about her, said not a word,
because in her heart she knew that her companion was
but a weak mortal, and so might be tempted to do the
very thing that would enable the god to turn her into
a complete bird again.</p>

<p class='c009'>Many times did Kora glance sideways at her beauty,
and his frame was thrilled with thoughts of love. At
length he looked around at Kasawayo, who, truth to tell,
had slipped a little into the rear so as to help Kora to
resist temptation. Then he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“O lovely spirit from shadowland, I can stand this
delay no longer. If you do not let me go and fight the
serpent, I am quite certain that I shall embrace and
kiss you.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“So be it!” said the sad spirit-woman, for she too
longed for the kisses of that mortal youth.</p>

<p class='c009'>With her heart trembling violently with a great fear,
Kasawayo said: “Come on! come!” and, turning round
again, led Kora towards the sea in the direction of the
serpent-god’s cavern.</p>

<p class='c009'>As they walked along, Kasawayo’s wings drooped and
almost covered the delicate flanks of her form. Kora,
who enviously watched every step of her soft feet as
they stirred the moonlit flowers of the forest floor, sighed
and sighed at the thought of the serpent-god’s power.
Often as they tramped along, Kora had to hide his eyes
with one of his hands, for, as Kasawayo turned round
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>the bends of the twining forest track, one wing would
flop slightly sideways and so reveal the smoothness and
exquisite beauty of her form.</p>

<p class='c009'>Presently they arrived at the mossy slopes that led
down to the seashore. For a moment they both
stood still and gazed through the forest breadfruit
trees out upon the silvered moonlit waters of the
sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly Kasawayo cried out:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, hark! though the ocean is calm, I can hear the
moaning of the thundering seas beating against the
barriers of the serpent-god’s cavern.” Then, with a deep
sigh, she continued: “O Kora, that noise that we hear
is a sure sign that the serpent is in a terrible passion
because I love you. Oh, what shall we do, what shall
we do?”</p>

<p class='c009'>She gazed into Kora’s eyes with tenderness, for the
beauty of mortality and immortality shone in the same
eyelight.</p>

<p class='c009'>Suddenly, with a cry of delight, as a thought came to
her, she said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“O my beloved Chief, I have just thought how we
can outwit the serpent-god. For listen! though you die,
still you will be mine, for, being a spirit, I shall then
be able to take you away to shadowland.”</p>

<p class='c009'>As the handsome Fijian chief listened, he lifted his
war-club and half imagined that he was already fighting
the serpent-god.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kasawayo gazed with admiration upon his herculean
frame, and sighed at the thought that she would never
possess him in a mortal state. Then she thought like
unto this:</p>

<p class='c009'>“But, still, I shall have his spirit in shadowland, and,
though even goddesses cannot have all they want, I shall
be satisfied with the spirit of so beautiful a youth, and,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>more, I can fold him in my arms and imagine he is a
beautiful mortal.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Her reflections were suddenly interrupted by Kora,
who gazed upon her with impassioned glance, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kasawayo, tell me where this cavern is. I would
meet the serpent at once, and, vanquishing it in combat,
possess your love and kisses.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kasawayo looked earnestly into Kora’s eyes, then,
falling forward on one of her rounded knees, and holding
a small bamboo branch in front of her bosom so that
their figures should be shielded from temptation, said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Kora, O beloved, let us gaze upon each other a
moment, for methinks it will be the last time I can drink
in your mortal beauty with these eyes.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So for a little while did they kneel together, inclining
their figures one towards the other. Poor Kora, who
was so truly mortal, gently blew his breath so that it
would reach Kasawayo’s tresses. As the soft, jetty curls
swayed gently to and fro to the zephyrs that crept from
his impassioned lips and revealed the curves of the goddess’s
dimpled shoulders, he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“O Kasawayo, ’tis sweet to breathe so, and know that
at least my breathing caresses your loveliness.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah me!” softly responded Kasawayo, as she, too,
breathed likewise, blowing the curls of Kora’s forehead
to and fro with the warm breath of her passion. The
very branches of the tall bamboos and palms seemed to
bend in leafy sympathy over them as they knelt and
gazed into each other’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“May I not touch, with my finger outstretched so,
the softest dimple of your throat, Kasawayo?”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kasawayo trembled from head to feet and nearly fell
forward at the pleading of the one whom she so much
loved. And it is rumoured that all the maidens who slept
at that moment in the native village of Nadranga, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>is on the banks of the river a mile away, dreamed of
the <i>one</i> youth who truly loved them, not only for their
beauty, but for the light of shadowland that shone in
their eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>It so happened that Kora, seeing the weakness of
Kasawayo, as she nearly fell forward into his arms,
quickly came to the rescue; for he at once ceased blowing
his breath into the tangled mass of hair that fell on the
goddess’s bosom. Then he swiftly placed his hand before
his eyes, and hid from Kasawayo’s sight the light
that he knew would prove their undoing if he persisted
in gazing upon her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Leaping to his feet he said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come, O my loved one, let me go and vanquish this
serpent-god. I never knew that I could hate a god so
much as I now hate the god who has come between us.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Kasawayo led the way down the slope. In a few
moments they both stood, like statues of despair, outside
the door of the serpent-god’s cavern.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come forth, O serpent!” said Kora, as he struck
his war-club a mighty blow against the coral rocks that
stood like pillars at the awful doorway.</p>

<p class='c009'>Kasawayo, remembering how she had promised to be
faithful to the god, trembled as her lover once more
struck the coral-pillars, till one of them fell crash at her
feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was then that a great, roaring sound, and what
sounded like the angry lashing of a mighty tail, came
out from the cavern’s gloom. Then the serpent’s huge
head appeared at the cavern’s door. In a moment Kora
bravely sprang forward, and the battle began.</p>

<p class='c009'>Silently Kasawayo watched. She knew that Kora
was mortal, and so had little chance in such an unequal
combat. So well did she know how the battle would go,
that she did not even cry out when the serpent’s tail
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>gave the brave Kora a terrible blow that stretched him
dead at her feet. For a moment she watched with a
strange look in her eyes. She knew that, did he not
truly love her, he would still lie as one dead. But it was
not so, for, as she watched, and the moonlight touched
Kora’s dead face, his shadow left his mortal body and
leapt straightway into Kasawayo’s outstretched arms.
The serpent-god, seeing this happen before his eyes,
roared with rage till the cavern shook and the rocks
around trembled as though from an earthquake. Going
forward on his belly, the god slashed at Kora’s body
with his tail. But it was only a dead body, and could
not be hurt more than death had hurt it. Looking up,
in his fearful rage, he saw Kasawayo and Kora’s spirit
hand in hand as they rushed away along the seashore.</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c009'>The first pale glimmer of dawn tinted the eastern
skyline, and yet a few stars were shining, when the little
Fijian children awoke in the villages. They all came
running out of the hut doors in the village of Rumbo-Rumbo.</p>

<p class='c009'>There was not a breath of wind stirring the palm trees
that sheltered their hut groves. So they rushed off fast
towards the sea to catch the fish in the shore lagoons.
Suddenly, as they ran along and the <i>Lukas</i> (parrots)
wheeled across the skies from the far-off mountains, they
all stood perfectly still. It was a wonderful sight that
met their gaze. For there, up in the sky, they distinctly
saw the spirits of Kasawayo and Kora, with their large
wings outspread, as they faded away with the stars far-off
over the seas.</p>

<p class='c009'>And to this very day, by the hut fires of the native
villages, the frizzly-headed old chiefs tell the children
how the handsome warrior Kora was seen in the arms
of the beautiful Kasawayo, as they passed away, flying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>together into shadowland—ages and ages ago. And still
the Fijians gaze with eyes of awe and complete reverence
at the serpents that glide across the forest floor
of their lovely isles. And if a chief should kill a bird
with gold tipping its wings, loud are their lamentations.</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c009'>A few days after my experiences in Fiji, I secured a
berth on a fore-and-aft schooner that was bound for
Samoa. After the usual discomfiture and rebellious irritation
to one of my temperament when obeying the orders
of disciplinary shipboard life, I arrived at Apia. The
skipper, who had relieved the monotony of the voyage
by telling me of his experiences when he sailed as mate
under the notorious Captain Bully Hayes, gave me several
pounds above my set wages, thus showing his appreciation
of my violin-playing. I had often done my
level best to extemporize suitable obligato to his vocal
attempts when he invited me into the stuffy cuddy after
eight bells. The mate died on the voyage across, and
when we buried him in his hammock-shroud, the skipper,
who read the burial service, had the best that was in
him awakened. Like most men he had a kind, brotherly
side to his rough exterior, and, as is usual with most
men, his congenial side only revealed itself through feeling
the near presence of the cold, poetic hand of death.
I know his voice was tremulous when he said, “Let
go!” and we softly dropped “Scotty” the mate into
the calm depths of the hot, tropic seas, where he left
a few bubbles behind him. Just before Scotty died, I
held his hand and said a few kind things, and I like to
fancy that his soul remembered and touched the skipper’s
heart with a generous impulse so that I might arrive
in Samoa with plenty of cash in my pocket.</p>

<p class='c009'>Being wealthy and having an hereditary hatred for
work, I mooched about for days, admiring the semi-poetic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>life of the natives, enjoying the generous fellowship
of the truest democracy the world ever harboured
or is ever likely to see. Then I met an aged mat-worshipper.
First, I must say that mat-worship was a
strange old Samoan custom that was still believed in
by the aged chiefs when I was a boy. A bit of old
tappa-cloth or fibre carpet was regarded as a sacred
object (<i>etua</i>).</p>

<p class='c009'>This <i>etua</i> was supposed to be a wonderful talisman, a
kind of Aladdin’s lamp; it was the “Open Sesame”
to all its worshippers’ hopes on earth and in the underworld
life-to-be. I became deeply interested in those
old mats, my susceptibilities being aroused much the
same as are the susceptibilities of those who visit the
ruins of ancient Rome and Pompeii. The mat-worshipper
with whom I became acquainted was an aged chief who
lived near Safata village. He possessed one of the aforesaid
revered objects. There it hung, just over his sleeping-couch
in his hut. Through being repeatedly kissed
and rubbed by the chief and his ancestors, for Heaven
only knows how many generations, it was dilapidated
and threadbare. I recall the very light that shone in that
aged chief’s eyes as he gazed on his sacred mat. Though
very aged he was still a fine distinguished-looking old
man. A vivid scar stained his well-curved, tawny shoulders,
for he had been a great warrior in his early days.
Throwing the tribal insignia of knighthood (a large
tappa-cloth rug of beautiful design) over his shoulders,
he drew himself up in a majestic manner, and gave me
a half-critical glance of defiance as I held my nose—for
that old mat smelt like the unclean hide of a mangy dog.
It was, to him, the most romantic and sacred of relics
and its odour exquisite incense! Young as I was, my
curiosity was aroused.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What is it for? Why so beautiful?” I inquired.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>Whereupon the old chief’s tattooed brow puckered up,
looking like a piece of parchment covered with hieroglyphics.
He gazed upon me half in pity, half in scorn.
Once more he reverentially gazed upon the mat. Then
in pigeon English, and with many half-childish gesticulations,
he endeavoured to enlighten my profound ignorance
as to the hidden virtues of that threadbare symbol
of the beautiful.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It am great god-mat, belonga to great chief only.
You white man, but all-e-samee you fool, you not one
great chief, you no got mat—eh?”</p>

<p class='c009'>So saying, he reverently lifted the mat from the wall-nail
and carried it outside the hut, where I discovered
that it was not such a dirty old bit of rubbish after all.
I quickly cast aside the assumed reverential aspect with
which I had masked myself that I might hide my boyish
levity. For, suddenly, I too gazed with genuine interest
on that mouldy object. Lo! particles of its threadbareness
glistened, shone in the sunlight! A tender feeling
came to me for that dirty old bit of matting when I did
exactly as the old native bade me—touched with my
fingers the shining skeins that waved among its coarse
fibres: it was the hair of some dead woman! It appeared
that some ancestress of the old chief’s had imparadised
that relic, for there shone her hair that had been delicately,
cleverly woven into the fibres of his sacred mat.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was greatly impressed by that old mat’s secret. Often
in my world-wide travels I have been asked to inspect
the heirlooms of great families and the relics of faded
dynasties, but nothing seems to have affected me or
aroused my admiration as that old mat and the pride of
its possessor did.</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c009'>It was about this period that I met another character
whom I found quite as interesting as my friend who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>owned the sacred mat. This new character was a poet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Talofa! Tusitala!” said the wrinkled native poet
when he welcomed me into his humble homestead.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then I played him several heathen strains on my violin.
His profile was of a Dantesque type, the nose finely
curved, and the deep-set eyes full of intellect. He prostrated
himself at my feet when I had finished playing
to him. I can never feel grateful enough to the old
mat-worshipper for introducing that mighty poet to me.
The wonderful tales he told and the delight I derived
from his friendship (for we went troubadouring together),
have made me wealthy in many a memory since.</p>

<p class='c009'>In Part II of this Volume I will endeavour to give
an impression of my memory of O Le Langi, the pagan
poet.</p>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c018'>IN the shadowland regions of a barbarian poet’s brain
flows the river Lethe that murmurs the most subtle
music of sentient Nature. Of such a poet I shall tell
in the following pages, one whom I instinctively understood.
For I also have stood in the primeval forest
and “heard the silent thunders of the leaves” and seen
the lightnings of a wild bird’s eyes, and God’s hand
carving a thousand pillars for the temples of Nature,
painting magical halls with the storied history of the
blue days and daubs of all the dead sunsets. Wonderful
eerie temples they were too. I have even been a pagan
and half fancied I have seen the dead children creep
out of the shadows and gaze around as they heard the
sad songs and whisperings of those old forest trees. Nor
was I deaf to the cry of anguish from the bleeding forest
flowers as my foot crushed their uplifted faces of brief
enough beauty. O Le Langi saw the world with such
eyes. He was the first poet of his race. He was crammed
full of mythical light, his imagination touching with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>splendour all that his eyes gazed upon. He hated most
white men and their wretched boast of advancement.
He deeply read the books of Nature, but threw the white
man’s <i>lotu books</i> into the sea! He too might well have
cried out to his chastened people who had accepted the
white man’s dogmas and gifts of clothing from the
European morgues:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Lo! thirty centuries of literature</div>
      <div class='line in1'>Have curved your spines and overborne your brains.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>O Le Langi’s ever earnest cry was:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Lo! centuries of grand belief in gods</div>
      <div class='line'>Have chasteneth us; my mind a forest is</div>
      <div class='line'>Of budding-light and thought’s bright spirit-flowers</div>
      <div class='line'>And faery-wings of Beauty’s moving hours.</div>
      <div class='line'>I am the darker-age grown old and thin—</div>
      <div class='line'>Personified, tattooed from toes to chin,</div>
      <div class='line'>And for you and your God care not one pin!</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Such was O Le Langi’s cry to the white men—O Le
Langi, who stands out like some wonderful, tattooed
bas-relief in the background of my memory.</p>

<p class='c009'>O Le Langi means <i>Chief of the Heavens</i>, and, so far
as his handsome physique and fine, expressive face were
concerned, he deserved that name. He was a fine sample
of his race. Though he lived in Samoa, he was a full-blooded
Marquesan, having emigrated from Nuka Hiva
to Samoa in his youth. His father had been high chief
of Queen Vaekehu’s royal bodyguard when that South
Sea Semiramis had reigned supreme over her dominions
and a thousand death-drums had called the hour of the
sacrificial festival. O Le Langi’s mother had escaped
from the rods of the French officials by beating a hasty
retreat from Nuka Hiva to Papeete some fifty years before
I met him. From Papeete she had stowed away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>in a trading schooner with her three little children, O Le
Langi and her two daughters.</p>

<p class='c009'>Both the girls had succumbed to the privations and
terrors of some long voyage in an open boat which had
finally drifted O Le Langi and his mother to the Samoan
Isles. The incidents of that terrible voyage O Le Langi
only hinted about. Nor was I one who would attempt
to learn more, it being quite obvious to me that the
sad old chief had some strange idea that the whole truth
of those days were best kept a secret in his own heart.</p>

<p class='c009'>Though secretive over the tragic history that had
caused his father’s execution and his mother’s flight from
her native land, O Le Langi never tired of telling me
the wonders of his tribe, and commemorating in words
the mighty deeds of his forefathers.</p>

<p class='c009'>His knowledge of heathen mythology was marvellous,
as were the tattooed armorial bearings, the insignia of
blue blood, which were visible on his massive chest. I
entertained no doubt whatever as to Le Langi’s royal
pedigree. Seeing that massive human parchment inscribed
with wondrous savage hieroglyhpics, the truth
of all he said was perfectly evident. I knew that the
Marquesans of royal blood had the tribal mottoes and
family crest tattooed on their sons before puberty.</p>

<p class='c009'>Langi looked liked some Greek god as he stood on
his village stump, his royal robe of the best tappa-cloth
swung about his rosewood-hued, majestic frame. Never
were the graceful, god-like shoulders wholly covered.
Even the maids, as they listened to his impassioned oratory,
sighed as the lightnings of poetic imagination leapt
from those fine dark eyes of his. Yes, old as he was.
By profession he was a travelling scribe, a genuine South
Sea poet. This talent he had inherited. For I discovered
that his father had once stood in the barbarian forums
of Tai-o-hae and spouted the charms of his queen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Vaekehu, commemorating in verse the warrior-like
deeds of the many brief kings who had ascended her
throne—and their deaths when she had tired of them.</p>

<p class='c009'>His temperament was Byronic, but at times he would
become strangely imbued with the savage instincts of his
race, becoming extremely bitter and cynical when his
fortunes were at a low ebb. For I must confess he had
a large share of the commercial spirit. This much I
noticed when he looked into the coco-nut-shell that he
always passed around amongst his audience. Often one
could see a poetic grin of extreme satisfaction end the
handsome wrinkles in a bunch up to the northern territory
of his high, bald, intellectual physiognomy as he counted
the collection.</p>

<p class='c009'>I never tired of listening to his way of telling the poetic
legends of his island world to the white men, though I
must admit that, beyond myself, few men of my colour
were interested in all he had to say. Grins and jokes
and indecent remarks were their highest contribution in
the way of interest or gifts when he finished his poems.</p>

<p class='c009'>I do not exaggerate in saying that, though Langi could
not speak our language better than an English child
of ten years, he was conversant with the works of many
of our poets. He had an old volume of Byron. He
asked me if I knew Keats!</p>

<p class='c009'>“He great Tusitala chief!” he said, when I told him
Keats was dead. Then he started off in raptures over
Saturn and the fallen deities and goddesses of <i>Hyperion</i>!
He had also read Longfellow’s <i>Hiawatha</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>It seemed a wonderful thing that one should leave
one’s country and travel thousands of miles across desolate
seas and pioneer lands, to find, at last, on a savage
isle of the remote wild South Seas, a savage who loved
poetry!</p>

<p class='c009'>It is true enough that the old chief got little appreciation
out of his talent, but many kicks.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>Poor O Le Langi! None of the natural chances of
the literary world came his way either by birth or luck.
He was born in a spot remote from all the dubious
possibilities that the civilized world offers to budding
aspirants. He had none to puff him. With all his
astuteness he could seize on no scheme that would elevate
him on a pedestal in the eyes of men. Alas! no
starving, unrecognized poet of another tribe expired on
his doorstep, so that the O Le Langi family for successive
generations might write the dead poet’s memoirs, and the
memoirs of their father’s memoirs concerning the poet’s
last sigh and the benevolence of the O Le Langi family
to the dying poet’s last ten minutes! Ah me! No publisher
chanced upon sad O Le Langi till I, a penniless
traveller, appeared on the scene, recognizing his wonderful
genius. And now that his body is dust beneath his
beloved coco-palms, I would write these humble memoirs
and commemorate the dust of the greatest poet I ever
met on earth.</p>

<p class='c009'>It is nothing against the posthumous poetic fame of
O Le Langi to say that he had loved passionately, more
than twice. Indeed, it is well known that men who are
not poets have this mortal failing.</p>

<p class='c009'>The amorous weakness of O Le Langi was impressively
forced upon me, for did I not walk beneath the coco-palms
and breadfruits to that silent, hallowed spot where
slumbered his sleeping passions?—the little native cemetery
where slept the dead women and children that he
had loved.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was through this sad visit that I heard so much;
for as O Le Langi knelt over each little mound of crumbling
dust he kissed the earth and wept like a child. I
saw at a glance that the solid earth did not hide from
the eyes of imagination the stretched figures, the
eyes, the lips, and the little fingers that he had once
loved.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>Rising to his feet he surveyed me with solemn eyes,
then said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, Papalagi, me now grow old and weak; me now
belonger to fool time.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, you don’t, great O Le Langi, high chief of handsome
bearing, and mightiest poet of the South Seas,”
said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>My heart was truly sorry for the old savage man,
and well I knew that such flattery was worth its weight
in gold at such a melancholy hour.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then I continued, as with an effort he drew his tattooed
shoulders up to their full proportion and looked
at the sky:</p>

<p class='c009'>“O Le Langi, they still live, those whom you love.
We all live again.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“But I no <i>cliston</i> or <i>popy mans</i>” (christian or prayer-man),
he responded in a mournful voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Phew! O great O Le Langi! It matters not a
tinker’s curse <i>what</i> you are so long as you <i>remain</i> as
you are.”</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment the old chief looked about him, as
though half in fright, then, seeing that we were unobserved,
he leaned forward and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You nicer man. You no think much of ole white-beard-Man-big-nose?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who’s he?” said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>“<i>Ole Misson-loom mans</i> (mission-room man) who
mournful voice, and who look at me and tell me that
I one big liar!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why?” said I, as the old poet’s face seemed to
flush beneath its tawny hue at the thought of such an
affront to his veracity.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I tells ’im I wanter no go white man’s ’eaven.
I go ’eathen ’eaven. Then ’e says, ‘There am no ’eathen
’eaven; yous sinfuls mans!’”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>Saying this, the old poet squatted down on his mat,
which he ever carried under his arm, and inspired by
grief dropped into the following poetic effusion. (The
sun had long since set, and the shadows lay deep in
the hollows by Mutoua. I sat down beside him, and
as he commenced in sombre tones, the <i>o le manoa</i> sang
its passionate strain up in the flamboyants over and over
again.)</p>

<p class='c009'>I recall the very note of that strange night-bird’s song
as O Le Langi meandered on in this wise:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>O white mans from across big waters,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>I die not though my body die, be dust:</i></div>

      <div class='line'><i>The </i>maona<i> in the forest singing, singing,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The stars softly dropping from great darkness</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>To whisper as they meet in deep, still lagoons,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The deep caves by Savaii, and Momo,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>The eyes of children romping by the red seashore</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>When even falls—I say, O white mans,</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>All these things shall be my dead-heart dreaming!</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>I great chief of gods, so never die dead.</i></div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>“And will you see your loved ones again when you
die, O Le Langi?”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>My love ones live, they are not dead.</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>They shine, their eyes in sky of darkness—</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>When sings the maona my dead love makes stars four!</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Her children shine as eight stars far away.</i></div>

    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<div class='footnote c022' id='f5'>
<p class='c021'><span class='label'><a href='#r5'>5</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The sea.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>“’Tis good O Le Langi, to know that your loved one
watches with her starry eyes over your dead children,”
I responded, as the scented sea wind stirred the feathery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>palms and dying forest flowers. The very trees seemed
to sigh some mystery into my ears as the old poet spoke,
or rather chanted on, saying that which I have so weakly
told. For a moment O Le Langi did not answer. Then,
with his massive chest swelling with emotion, he slowly
raised his handsome, old wrinkled face. He looked like
some marvellous bronze statue as he lifted his head and
chin skyward. I dared not speak as I saw him lift his
arm and, with hand archwise over his eyes, stare at
that tremendous manuscript of heathen-night. Then he
pointed with one long, tawny finger to the heavens. For
a little moment that dark, thin finger wavered with indecision,
then it steadily pointed straight toward the
far north-west—and lo! I saw his beloved dead (her
who had died thirty years before) looking out of the
sparkling constellation. Yes, two bright stars—her eyes!
It appeared that she was watching over the little group
of pale stars that wistfully stared from the east to the
north-west—they were the spirits of O Le Langi’s four
dead children. It was some time ere he lowered his
chin, for he had watched long and strangely those stars
that he claimed.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the shadows deepened and wild odours of citrons
and decaying pineapples drifted on the cool sea wind, I
relit my pipe. Once more the old poet looked at me
with ambitious pride gleaming from his eyes over my
rapt attention and praise. Then he continued in sombre
tones that which was apparently of magnificent import
to him:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'><i>One night I stand by sea-coast, dreaming</i></div>

      <div class='line'><i>I felt much sad as shadows of night falling</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Went like big lava-lava round the waist of Night</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>As her big black feet rest on side of moonrise!</i></div>
      <div class='line'><i>Long before stars in sky go indoors of morning,</i></div>

<p class='c023'>“What did the old crab, the chief, I mean, say then?”
said I, as the old poet leaned his chin right down to the
hieroglyphic tattoo of his chest, lapsing into deep thought.
In respectful attitude I awaited his next inspiration,
which came in this wise:</p>

      <div class='line'><i>He wise ole crab-chief and know much, O Pagalagi.</i></div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c018'>AH, sublime poet O Le Langi! It was your elemental
poetic genius, more than the inspirations of the poets
of my own land, that first turned my thoughts to the
magic of the seas, skies, travelling stars, and the strange
look in men’s eyes. ’Twas you who made me hear the
ineffable sounds of music, the visionary sights and the
wonders of night and moonlight in the forest. Yours
was the mercy that lent me the ear to hear the pleading
voice of the unfledged song in the red-splashed bird’s
egg, till I carefully climbed back and laid it once more
in the mossy nest high in the banyans. It was you who
inspired me to stand on the palm-clad slopes, by the
sapphire-hued Pacific waters, and see the glorious mist
of God’s breath pervade the circumambient life of this
mirror of a universe that shadows forth His infinite
dreams. ’Twas you who led me into the magic parlour
of infinite splendour where birds, goddesses, and gods
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>sang and lifted their goblets of nectar, toasting in song
their joy and thanksgiving to the laughing, flying hours—hours
that peeped through the magic door of the sunrise.
I too stood by that wondrous shanty door, where the
palms sang, and stretched my shadow-arm to the skyline,
while with goblet in hand I dipped and filled it
to the brim with the sparkling foam from the golden
sunsets of the wine-dark seas! Yes, Langi, I also drank
the intoxicating ecstasy of those foaming hours of crimson
and golden light. Yet, Langi, I, sceptic that I was,
once doubted you when you stood by the moonlit waterfalls
of the forest and swore that you saw the silvery
flowing beards and big jagged knees of the gods. In
the blindness of my worldly vision I swore that it was
nothing more than the foaming moonlit waters falling
down the fern-clad crags of the mountain’s side: no
knees, no gigantic rugged faces of gods at all! I even
doubted that the dark, Old-Man-Frog’s hind-legs, as he
swam deep in the still depths of the star-mirroring water
of the lagoon, touched with his webbed feet and scattered
the constellation of stars that were the proud eyes
of your mighty ancestors who ever watched over you
from the skies out to the north-west. Ah, how blind
I was! But I became a true pagan after that. It was
I who taught you to sing the songs of Cathay and the
melodies of mediæval romance of Long Ago. Who will
believe that we heard the winds tolling the bells of Time,
faintly, far away in some infinite belfry of the stars,
as the violin wailed and your aged, cracked voice chanted?
Yes, long ago, when strange, blue-eyed Danes and
Homeric sailormen from the semi-fabled seas threw silver
coins into our old collecting-calabash! I thank you and
Heaven, O Le Langi, that once I was rich beyond the
dreams of avarice. Notwithstanding the beauty and
truth of the Christian apostles, it was you, old heathen,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>who invested me with a glamour, threw over the shoulders
of this dilapidated catastrophe Me, a magical cloak, the
texture whereof I am unable to explain. That old cloak
of many colours and glorious illusions has long since
been torn to a thousand shreds. But out of each old
heap, the <i>débris</i> of shattered illusions, have blossomed,
from the seeds of old enchantments, other flowers.
Beautiful too are the flowers of disenchantment! But
away with such rhapsodizing, for I must return as gracefully
as possible to my immediate memoirs.</p>

<p class='c009'>About this time I had a recurrence of yellow jaundice.
My liver was a healthy one; but on my first visit to
Samoa, a year before, I had foolishly eaten of some red-berry
fruit that turned out to be most poisonous. I
had, in consequence, suffered a serious illness. Indeed,
I had turned a yellowish-green, and finally had taken
a voyage to Honolulu to seek special medical advice.
Whilst in Honolulu my visage became so distressingly
yellow and my aspect so melancholy that the chief undertaker,
Rami Sarhab, gave me fifteen dollars a week to
act as chief mute and mourner at the royal burial
ceremonies. But even in this capacity my services failed
lugubriously; for I felt such pain in the abdomen, was
so intensely sad, that the envy expressed in my eyes and
on my bilious-green physiognomy for the deep, painless
slumber of the defunct was conspicuous to all eyes, as I
walked ahead of the hearse, endeavouring my best to
mourn over the dreamless sleep of the departed. Thank
Heaven, my second attack of jaundice left me in a few
days. A local native physician, Rimoloo, recommended
me to drink deeply of the water from boiled yams and
breadfruits flavoured with Holland gin; and my delight
on changing colour at the fourth gallon can be better
imagined than described to those who have drunk of the
aforesaid mixture.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>While enjoying the congenial companionship of O Le
Langi I deserted my study of instrumental music and
harmony and turned my thoughts to poetry. A trader
at Matautu, Savaii Isle, had presented me with a volume
of A. L. Gordon’s poems and Whitman’s <i>Leaves of Grass</i>.
The perusal of these volumes amidst romantic surroundings
intensified the ardent love I have ever felt for Nature
in all her wildest moods. Indeed, I have often stood
before an aged, dying forest-tree and felt some affectionate
kinship with its sensate sorrow over its approaching
dissolution. Strange as it may seem to some, I must
confess that old wooden ships, deserted huts, stuffed
birds, and the like have appealed to me far more than
the tender melodies of beautiful songs and the thrills
of romantic books. Even the thick mahogany wood
of my arm-chair calls up vistas of some mammoth tree
of the southern forest. What song-birds settled on its
boughs to stay and sing awhile on their flight! And
what wild men, women, and weary children on the
strange, long tribal march camped beneath their shelter—the
shelter of boughs that now encircle my recumbent,
dreaming form in this inn’s carven arm-chair!</p>

<p class='c009'>I remember that, after reading Whitman’s poems, I
began to write words to the many melodies that I was
continually composing. I was surprised at the ease
with which poetical ideas seemed to come to me. My
brain teemed with suitable poetic similes. But my workmanship
was execrable. Many of my lyrics were inspired
by home-sickness. I recall that I wrote about thirty
songs. Probably three of them were good. I know that
I set a high value on those sentimental lyrics and that
I placed them in my tin box with my prized volume of
E. Prout’s <i>Harmony and Counterpoint</i>, so that they
might be safe until that day when I could submit them
to a publisher. But no publisher’s musical editor ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>had them inflicted upon him. My ship, a year later, was
wrecked off the Solomon Isles; and I stood under the
shore palms, with all my beloved inspirations at the
bottom of the ocean, and passed in review, so I grimly
imagined, by the tuneful mermaids of the coral seas.
Many of the stranded sailors’ effects were washed ashore
the next day, but were immediately snatched up by the
thieving natives, who bolted off with them into the mountain
villages. Perhaps those wild tattooed men got hold
of my sacred tin box. And if any talented cannibal sings
my old songs, and is well up in the mysteries of harmony
and counterpoint, he has undoubtedly made greater headway
in that difficult art than I had in those days. But
still, it is something that I should be able to claim to
be the first who introduced E. Prout’s volume of <i>Harmony
and Counterpoint</i> into the cannibal Solomon Isles.</p>

<p class='c009'>I remember that O Le Langi asked me to translate the
words of many of his legendary poems into my own
language. My heathen poet’s face lit up with pride when
I sang some of his songs in my own tongue, and with
equal pride made a forcible accent on the rhymes so
that he could hear how the lines went. O Le Langi
at once enticed me to go with him round the coast
to Mootua, so that I might let his rival scribes hear
how nice his poems sounded when translated into the
great Papalagi’s language. He was so delighted with
the obvious jealousy that was expressed on the wrinkled
faces of his rivals that he struck his chest thrice and
flung one hand behind his back. I discovered that this
act of Langi’s was a direct challenge to them to compose
the words of a song as well as he. One of the older
scribes, at once accepting the challenge, stepped forward
and, swelling the magnificent hieroglyphic tattoo of his
chest, chanted an impromptu legend. Though I could
not understand all the words of this legendary improvization,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>I remember that the melody was so effective that
I extemporized with ease an accompaniment on my
violin. This brought forth a volley of applause from
the whole tribe, who had rushed from their huts to listen
to the wonderful magic wood-scraping of the white
<i>Tusitala</i> (maker of songs). For a while I quite expected
there would be a fight between the rivals. But things
smoothed down. I was finally awarded a calabash of
kava, which I courteously placed to my lips, and then,
whilst the chiefs were talking, poured the contents into
the fern grass at my feet. At this moment the high
chief’s daughter, a sea-blue-eyed maid with a veritable
forest of bronze-hued hair, fell on one knee before me
and started to sing a weird melody. For a moment I
was considerably embarrassed. I soon, however, recovered
my wits, and then I took her hand and bade her
rise. My imagination clothed me with a majesty which
I had gathered from my old novels. And I distinctly
recall the admiration in the eyes of the onlookers as I
slightly lifted my helmet hat and then bowed as though
I were some mighty king paying court to a princess of
a neighbouring dynasty. She handed me a beautifully
carved tortoise-shell comb from her hair, and the glance
that accompanied the gift cannot be divulged in mere
words. I responded by diving my hand into my breast
pocket, and then handed her a really valuable silver
match-box. She blushed deeply, for the munificence of
my return gift was obvious. That same night O Le
Langi and myself were the chief guests at the festival
board of the <i>fale fapule</i> (chief house). And as I sat at
the head of the long low table and the steam rose from
the mighty dishes of roast pig and many indigenous
fruit dishes, Essao’s eyes, for that was her name, gave
me swift, bright glances that told all that a romantic
Samoan maid’s eyes can tell when her heart warms to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>a stranger. But, notwithstanding my ardent nature and
the lure of her bright eyes, I was saved from early matrimony,
for when the head chief caught me bowing
gallant acknowledgments to his daughter’s eyes, his
brow wrinkled up into a tortuous map of disapproval.</p>

<p class='c009'>Nevertheless, when O Le Langi and I left the village
that night, Essao gave me her tenderest secret glance
and managed to present me with a flower from her hair.
Though I did not see her again, I wrote many verses
about her beauty.</p>

<p class='c009'>I think that it was about this period that I wrote
several of the poems that were later on published in my
little booklet of <i>Australian and South Sea Lyrics</i>. This
little booklet of verse, to my surprise and pleasure, was
highly praised in the literary journals in England, and
also brought me letters of encouragement from such men
as Henry Newbolt, William Michael Rossetti, and Robert
Bridges.</p>

<p class='c009'>But to proceed with those adventurous happy days
when the light of the great poet O Le Langi’s eyes shone
upon me. Whilst stopping with Langi I was down with
severe fever. I was staying at the time in a native
homestead quite near to the aged scribe’s residence.
Langi was very kind to me, and secured the services of a
native woman to attend to my wants. This Samoan lady
had a child who was about four years old. He was an
intelligent little fellow and had ocean-blue eyes and curly
hair. When I sat up on my bed-mat, tinkling melodies
on my violin, Ramao, for that was his name, would
somersault with delight; then once again peep inside
the <i>F</i> holes of my instrument to see where the music
came from. Every day he would run off into the forest
to pluck flowers for me, and would make my bed with
soft moss, attending to my wants with the unremitting
solicitude of a lovable, innocent child. Heaven knows
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>where he learnt the weird songs that he sang to me as
he sat by my bedside, swaying to and fro like some elfin-child.
Lying there stricken with fever, I would stare
into his beautiful, original eyes till the whole world
seemed to be singing in its happy childhood. I realized
that the age of four was the golden age of mortal existence,
the age that understands the grandest philosophy
of life, the age when all the infinite possibilities are as
near consummation as they can well be in this world.
Much that had puzzled my wretched civilized brain as
I listened to O Le Langi’s long discourses became clear
to me. Langi was not such a fool after all; it was I who
was the heathen! The iron laws of my country had sent
me to school so that my God-given wisdom should be
strangled by dogmatic heathenish teachers. I recalled
how the great and splendidly religious Langi had
crashed his club down on his threshold, and in magnificent
declamatory style had said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pah! Foolish white-skinned man, he come here
with his mouldy skull full of worms so that he may
teach us also to grow old, scraggy, and full of wretched
wisdom. He hears not the voices of the gods murmuring
in the children’s babblings.” Then that aged scribe
had laid his wrinkled hand on my head, and in sonorous,
melancholy tones had said: “O Papalagi, I say, your
people looker beyond the mountains at the stars for the
wisdom of the great waters when ’tis only to be heard
in the sweet-toned shells that are scattered on the sunny
shores of childhood.”</p>

<p class='c009'>So spake Langi. And I, who knew that we are born
in fullest possession of the divine faculties only that we
may grow old and sad, had at once become a true disciple
of that glorious old heathen. Indeed, I almost succeeded
in realizing that the peoples of the civilized world were
my humble attendants, and that O Le Langi, crammed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>with mythology and strange tales about sad old crabs,
was a heathen Solomon arrayed in the splendour of the
stars. Langi could stand on the mountain peaks of
supreme “ignorance,” whisper into the ear of the universe,
and, listening, hear those Truths that only murmur
in some great speech of silence to the soul.</p>

<p class='c009'>I know that the light of little Ramao’s eyes also filled
my soul with some strange, intuitive wisdom. When the
little fellow opened his eyes wide and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, listen, Papalagi, to the <i>O le mao</i> bird as it sings
to the light of the mountain stars,” I did not hear a
night-bird singing to its mate in the banyan trees, but
I heard a soft-feathered transmutation of a blue day of
ages ago singing tenderly, sadly, to some memory of its
birth in the rosy eternity of the east. Ramao’s presence
in that hut, where I lay sick with fever, cast a poetic
glamour over my existence. One evening he rushed
into the hut, and, stooping down by my bed-mat, swiftly
covered my shoulders with the tappa-rug. Then he
turned to the doorway and gave a whistle, and softly
called out:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Essimao, come in and see wonderful white boy who
play on magic wood.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He had brought his sister to see me. There she stood,
a charming little maid of about seven years, peeping
curiously at me through the half-open doorway. I
called her; and, as though she had been born for the
purpose of waiting on men in sickness, she straightway
squatted by me and commenced to sing. Her voice
rippled from her lips like the deep-stealing music of a
forest stream. Rising to her feet she swayed softly,
and it seemed that the rhythm of music rose and fell in
tiny billows along the graceful movements of her limbs.
Her laughter was sweetest balm to my fevered soul.
She was a perfect little gipsy of the sea-nursed south.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_223'>223</span>I know that if the delightful George Borrow, that true
lover of the Romany Chile, had reached the South Seas
and had seen Essimao place a seashell to her ear and
swear that she could hear the big <i>moani ali</i> (ocean)
beating on the shores of God’s mountain footstools,
he would, I am sure, have devoted pages to the beauty
of Essimao and the religious influence her presence
inspired. I know that she impressed me more than all
the Psalms could do. The sayings of the Apostles and
the teachings of Confucius, down to those of Kant and
Strindberg, etc., are as nothing to me when compared
with the wisdom and charm of little Essimao and
Ramao’s four infinite years. Those little philosophers
made me realize, long ago, the cursed irony of the fates
in decreeing that man should be born the wrong way
up, so that we grow old instead of young. But my
memory does not betray me when I assert here that O
Le Langi was an exception, a phenomenon who had outwitted
the fates, had never grown out of his wise,
resplendent infancy. Like the child of four years, he
was still a mighty philosopher, a true socialist, romanticist,
individualist, poet, humorist, spritualist, realist,
optimist, pessimist, mystic, maniac, prophet, and one
who had the transcendentalist’s belief in a Supreme
Being; and lo, all this encased in one skull crammed
with the divine light that we are all gifted with when
we are four years old. Ah, the wondrous book that an
imaginative child of four years could give us could it
write down its impressions, its own outlook on life and
all that it imagines about this world! What marvellous
truths would its great unworldliness spring upon us!
Once, when I lay near to death, Ramao lay on one side
of me and Essimao on the other, placing their fingers
in sympathy through my hair. I felt that I had travelled
so far that I had stumbled on the edge of the earth that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>is nearest the heavens. Perhaps I digress unduly in my
reflections over Ramao and Essimao, when it is only
children in the hey-day of life’s philosophical prime who
can understand the truth of that which I say. Few may
believe the virtues that I claim for my old friend Langi
and these children. Langi, who had read many of the
abridged editions of the standard works, cursed the
outrageous vanity of white men. His nervous, sensitive
nostrils would dilate, his sonorous, eloquently violent
voice ringing out like the mellow poetry of old bells as
he declaimed:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pah! What am this white Papalagi more than a
pale-skinned thief of the night? Am he not the dark
misbeliever who slay our mighty gods and doubt their
virtues—and us?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“True! true! O mighty O Le Langi!” I’d say, as I
listened in incorrigible delight, while with chin and hand
raised to the sky he spoke on:</p>

<p class='c009'>“The white Papalagi am one great hypocrite, who
loveth the earth, money, and old clothes—neither doth
he smell over-sweet! Where? Where is this God who
had power to fashion this white man, yet, lo, made some
First Great Mistake—since I am brown?” And saying
this, O Le Langi dashed his coco-nut-shell goblet
to the ground, and exclaimed: “Think you ’tis wise
His faults to change?” And still he would rave on
in this wise: “I say, O Papalagi, had the first white
man discovered my people living in one great town
that had a leaning tower, and one rotunda and nicer
cathedrals with great stained-glass windows, they would
have said: ‘O great Samoan Peoples! God’s eyelight
doth shine in thy sight; your women, too, are beautiful
as the stars and flowers. O wondrous brown men, I
greet you, Allelujah!’” Then, wiping the tears of
tense emotion from his eyes, he wailed forth: “Alas,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>my people lived in huts, therefore were severely belaboured
with rods and their daughters sold into slavery
and worshipped only for their bodies’ beauty.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Even as I write I can hear O Le Langi sigh: “Alas!
Alas! Papalagi the faithful,” as his ghost peers over
my shoulder to-night as I pen these memoirs. Yes, O Le
Langi could see “Heaven in a wild flower and Eternity
in a grain of sand.” Little Ramao, too, felt quite equal
to the white men, and honestly claimed everything from
the stars down to my boots and my violin. He even
claimed my parents’ photographs which I kept in my
tin box, for he placed them carefully in the folds of his
lava-lava when I was not looking—true little socialist
that he was. And, when he fell from the palm tree,
whilst seeking coco-nuts, and broke his back, he died
with a smile on his lips that had God’s philosophy in it.</p>

<p class='c009'>The tears fell fast from O Le Langi’s eyes when he
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“O Papalagi, the seas do roll on for ever, but man
go back to his fathers.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the winds sighed mournfully in the coco-palms,
and O Le Langi softly dug his fingers into the heap of
soft-scented mould, and dropped the first lump of earth
down on to Ramao’s dead, smiling face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aue! Aue!” wailed the stricken mother, as we turned
away from the graveside. And three or four little
children who had stood watching the burial procession
from the shades of the flamboyant trees, cried: “Wa
noo! Wa noo!” and then disappeared in some fright
down the forest tracks. Such was the end of Ramao
as the sunset fired the far-off sea horizon. The cicalas
were chrruping in the belts of mangroves as we arrived
once more at Langi’s homestead.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a long time after that sad incident I fancied I
could hear some wail of sorrow in the mournful monotones
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>of the waves that incessantly beat against the
barrier reefs. But the splendid reality of the hot sunlight
again came over the world. Again Time turned
the withered pages of each blue tropic day, pages that
faded into the yellowing of each sunset. Flowers on
the slopes grew musical with bees. Fierce happiness
reigned in the tribal villages along the coast as the old
chiefs chanted their savage memories of olden time and
the children thumped toy drums. Bright-eyed maidens
and amorous youths laughed and sang. Then O Le
Langi enticed me to go off troubadouring with him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We maker lot moneys, O Tusitala!” said he.</p>

<p class='c009'>And so I went, and O Le Langi carried my violin
as we tramped miles and miles visiting the coast villages.
Sometimes we hired a canoe and paddled to the many
islets of the Samoan group. With his tappa robe
wrapped about him, the tasselled end flung cavalier-wise
over one shoulder, O Le Langi would stand with chin
raised as he stood in the old tribal forums of many a
lonely native village, chanting melodiously as I played
on my violin. Even the white men, traders and sailors
in the grog-bars near Matautu, down by the beach on
Savaii Isle, left their rum mugs, strode to the bar doorway,
listened and stared, as Langi told wonderful things
about his old gods, pointing magnificently to the trees,
the distant mountains and seas, calling them mighty witnesses
of all which he would claim for the beauty of his
legendary world. The old shellbacks opened their eyes
in astonishment, tugged their beards, spat seaward, and
stared again, as the earnest note in his voice gained even
their ragged respect. It must have been a strange sight
as my pagan brother-artist stood before them, clothed
in the majesty of a past tribal chiefdom and the glory
of a proud imagination that they could not understand.
But what cared I, as with fiddle to my chin I played on,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>my helmet hat tilted back on my head, till O Le Langi’s
wheezy voice gave the final chant ere he snatched that
dilapidated shelter from the tropic sun off my head,
and held it under the eyes of those sunburnt men from
the seas!</p>

<p class='c009'>Ah, memory of Langi and true romance! Great,
unlaurelled poet of the South Seas, how satisfied you
were with your earthly existence! How satisfied with
the poetic fame you achieved as your kind critics cast
coins of approval into my shabby helmet hat—that old
hat that held the joy and romance of my youth and all
that was wealth inexhaustible to you—and me! Often
in my deeper dreams I see you standing beneath your
beloved palms near Apia as you watch the gold of the
setting sun sinking into the western seas. Ah, kind old
heathen, again I see your grim glance when you look
at the woebegone faces of the missionaries as they pass
you by; and, as you watch them, I see your aged lips
smile and quiver into that poetic grin that seems to say:</p>

<p class='c009'>“There, but for God’s mercy, goes O Le Langi!”</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c009'>As some may think I have overestimated the comeliness
and mentality of the majority of the old-time
Samoans, I would like to give other opinions than my
own on the subject before finishing this chapter. First
of all, I would mention that all observant, able authorities
who have travelled, and written about the South
Seas, have remarked upon the fine physique and general
attractiveness of the Polynesian races. In my profession,
and I was bandmaster of the king’s bodyguard
band in Hawaii, in Tahiti, and again in Mexico, etc., I
had many opportunities of hearing the opinions of the
various representatives of the Missionary Societies, and
they were very often men of refined tastes, and so competent
to judge. These men all seemed to share my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>opinion with respect to the manliness and refinement
of the Samoans. Of course, a difference of opinion
is bound to exist, for, to be sure, there is a class of men
who, by an inherent obliquity of mental vision, see all the
coloured races as something semi-bestial and unworthy
of a white man’s interest and sympathy.</p>

<p class='c009'>I once had the pleasure of arriving in Apia with
Monsieur Bassaire, a well-known French artist. I vividly
recall his astonishment and admiration when he
first saw the Samoans who came on deck to welcome
us when we arrived off Mulinuu. Nor was Bassaire’s
surprise to be wondered at, for the handsome, sun-bronzed,
herculean figures of the Samoan men were
shown off to tremendous advantage as they stood on
deck amongst the slop-shouldered, thick-necked German
crew. Bassaire, who had travelled in New Guinea in
1879 with James Chalmers, the God-fearing, adventurous
missionary,<a id='r7' /><a href='#f7' class='c019'><sup>[7]</sup></a> was touring the world, and was taking
sketches of the various races of mankind. I know that
he was pleased with his artistic work in Samoa. Bassaire
was introduced to Robert Louis Stevenson, and it was
whilst they were in each other’s company that I heard
R. L. S. comment on the clear complexions of the Samoans.
We were in the photographer’s studio in Apia, and
Stevenson was examining some of the photographs.
The photographer told us that, though hundreds of
native girls and youths presented themselves at his
studio in hopes that they would make photographs of
commercial value for book illustrations and for selling
to tourists, he was invariably able to choose only two,
or three at most, who possessed the thick lips and sensual
features that coincided with the stock European idea of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>the South Sea type. Indeed, when Stevenson glanced
through the albums, he actually mistook some of the
photographs of the Samoans, which were toned in a
light shade, for Europeans. R. L. S. remarked that he
considered that in some ways the Samoans were amongst
the handsomest races to be found in the world. However,
they become slightly broad in the nose as they
get older and the lips become sensual-looking; the skin,
which in youth is of a golden hue, deepens to a tawny
hue with age, the complexion becoming swarthy, something
akin to that of the Spanish, Italian, Southern
French, and the darker types of British. Of course,
these remarks refer to the true-blooded types of over
twenty years ago. Through intermarriage with Mongolians,
Negroes, Malays, Papuans, and low-caste British,
the herculean Samoan is becoming a very rare individual
indeed. The statue-like figure is becoming bent and
dwarfed, the full, clear eyes crafty-looking. I know
that the surviving children of the old race, who now
roam those palm-clad slopes, struck me, on a later day,
as a kind of human rainbow, some aftermath that sadly
reflected the tropic suns, the light and laughter of other
brighter days. For now one meets all kinds of complexion—yellowish,
brownish, white-blotched, mauve,
greenish, tawny, and black, and eyes as multitudinous in
colour as their own tropic flowers. At times it is hard
to tell the half-caste from the pure-blooded white man
or woman.</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f7'>
<p class='c021'><span class='label'><a href='#r7'>7</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The author met James Chalmers in Apia and again at Port
Moresby, New Guinea. Chalmers was a splendid type of the earnest
missionary—manly, sincere, and brave, and a true Bohemian. He
was murdered by New Guinea cannibals a few years ago.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>The last remark recalls to my mind a little incident
that it may not be out of place to mention here. Robert
Louis Stevenson heard that a white woman was residing
near Matautu, Savaii Isle. He at once made up his
mind to go and see this lady—a natural enough wish
in those remote isles, “where white men will tramp
miles to catch a glimpse of a white woman.” Well,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>R. L. S. hired a boat from a half-caste who was a store-keeper,
and with whom I was staying at that time.
And so it happened that I and the mate of a schooner
had the pleasure of accompanying R. L. S. in the boat.
After a long, very wearying row from Manono, for it
was a terrifically hot day, we arrived off the coast of
Savaii. Even then we had to go ashore and tramp
over two miles before we could reach the bungalow
where the white lady resided. When we did arrive,
Stevenson was nearly “dead-beat,” and struck me as
irritated and fatigued. It was with much relief that
the three of us at length passed under the shade of
the mango-trees that sheltered the approach to the bungalow.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where’s the white lady?” said Stevenson, speaking
in rather a sharp manner to a tawny-looking female
who wore a small dark moustache and happened to be
looking out of the bungalow’s doorway. To our astonishment
the woman screwed her mouth up and shrieked
out:</p>

<p class='c009'>“What white lady?—damn yer eyes!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Stevenson’s consternation and my own can be better
imagined than described, when I say that the sun-tanned,
brown-skinned, vulgar-looking woman who addressed us
was the beautiful white lady herself! And, if I may
say so, she was a good specimen of the white lady to
be found in the South Seas in those days.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’ave a beer, old party?” she said to R. L. S., who
had astutely apologized and cursed the hot sunlight that,
shining in his eyes, had made him so colour-blind.</p>

<p class='c009'>Stevenson’s tact, after that grievous mistake, had a
magical effect on the manners of our countrywoman.
She fastened a flower on R. L. S.’s coat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Say when!” she said to the mate, as she clutched
the gin bottle, holding it high as she filled the glass.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>Then she smacked me on the back, and filled with
beer a huge receptacle that looked like one of those
fancy glasses wherein one keeps goldfish. I think Stevenson
had whisky. I know he enjoyed the situation. The
lady made eyes at R. L. S. and the mate too. She swore
and behaved with the convivial vulgarity that is the
sole prerogative of the low-caste British woman. I know
that the Samoan servant-maid blushed as her mistress
complained of the “’orrible ’eat,” and pulled her dress
down below her Camberwell-South-East bosom. Who
she was, why she was there alone in that bungalow, only
God knows. I recall that she nudged Stevenson in the
ribs and said she came from “Camberwool Sarth-East.”
She swore at everything in Samoa, and said that she
never went “art of a night because she knew the blasted
natives were cannyballs!” Stevenson’s face during all
this was a perfect study in self-control and amused politeness;
and nothing off the stage could possibly outrival his
simulated interest and his convivial ejaculation of “Well
now!” as she finished each breezy yarn and ribald joke.</p>

<p class='c009'>The mate was a London man.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you remember the ‘Pig and Whistle’?” she
screamed, as she plunged into reminiscent talk about the
“old homeland,” smacked the mate on the shoulder,
and pinched my leg! She insisted on fillng our glasses
again and again. She commenced to sing. Her wild,
silvery laughter rippled about our ears, mesmerized us
all, and made the roosting parakeets in the orange-trees
outside rise, flutter and shriek with fright.
Stevenson was the first to attempt to withdraw from
that little realistic drama of life in a South Sea bungalow.
His æsthetic, intellectual-looking face became shadowed
with a fierce determination as the wild familiarities of
the woman asserted themselves. He bowed with urbane
politeness as he rose from the table.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>“Git the gentleman’s ’at, yer little brown-skinned
slut!” she yelled.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a moment the trembling Polynesian maid made a
dive for Stevenson’s old peaked cap. Stevenson was
still expressing in his politest terms the pleasure he felt
at meeting the lady in the island.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Stow it, yer son of a gun! No politeness ’ere! You
know where to find me, and <i>don’t</i> forget me when yer
comes this way!” she said, as we passed through the
doorway.</p>

<p class='c009'>Stevenson nearly fell down her bungalow’s five steps
as she yelled forth a volley of ribald farewells. The
relief of that parting was very evident on Stevenson’s
face. He chuckled like a schoolboy when we had embarked
and were all rowing our hardest, far away, safe
out at sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>But to return to O Le Langi. Many of the old-time
chiefs of Langi’s type were faithful to their old creeds
in many ways, and lived just as they had done in the
heathen days. Indeed, Langi lived as though white men
had never trod on his isles. He was deeply imbued
with the old commercial spirit. Like the mediæval merchants
of Cathay who travelled far with their scented
merchandise, Langi would go wandering from village
to village and isle to isle. True enough, he did not
travel with a camel across mighty deserts, but was his
own caravan; for he carried, by the aid of a large calabash
slung over his own hump, not sandalwood, topazes,
diamonds, and opals for mummies’ eyes, but set off
with pink shells, corals, tappa-cloth, and magic charms
that had been warmed by the soft bosoms of mighty
queens on their wedding-nights. These charms were
small precious stones that he ran through his fingers
whilst mumbling his pagan prayers.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What may they be, those little shining stones, O
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>mighty O Le Langi?” said I one night, as he trickled
the gems through his fingers and gazed in a most
mysterious way on the stars. He then informed me
that they were the old magic jewels of the ancient
Samoan dynasty, and their value was beyond all price.
It turned out that they had once been threaded on the
skeins of a maiden’s hair so that they might be warmed
on the virgin bosom of her whom a king was about to
take to wife. It appeared that on the eve of the wedding
the royal bride slept with the stones warm on her bosom,
and that the warmth imparted to them was the sapphire
and ruby light which shone in their depths as Langi
ran them through his fingers.</p>

<p class='c009'>One may wonder how O Le Langi obtained possession
of the magic Crown jewels of the old Samoan dynasty;
but he was a true scribe and, possibly, knew the ropes.
Even in my time, kings and queens were not too severe
in Court etiquette. Here I will simply say that, through
possessing a bottle of the best Holland gin, I have
received the highest Court honours from South Sea
Royalty. Indeed, I was once offered a princess’s hand
in marriage, as well as being presented with the “freedom
of the pagan city,” because the half-blind old king (in
the Paumotou group) had been told by his head chief
that I had a flask of the best Jamaica rum in my coat
pocket. I seldom visited South Sea Royalty without a
bottle of gin on my person.</p>

<p class='c009'>Langi never tired of expatiating on the beauty of the
Samoan and Marquesan maidens of his youth. He
would lift his chin to the sky, and curse the day when
the maids were forced by the missionaries to wear the
Europeans’ cast-off clothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ugh! O Papalagi of the spirit-finger, we no do
cover the flowers with stink-cloth and so hide the loveliness
of their leaves; then why, I say, should new-time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>fool-men cover nicer girls, women, and mans down to
feets?”</p>

<p class='c009'>So raved O Le Langi, as I sympathetically muttered:
“True! true, O mighty Langi!”</p>

<p class='c009'>But it must be admitted that the long pink and blue-striped
night-gown-like attire of the maids suited them
admirably. It was a pretty sight to see a flock of native
girls running along the shore sands, delighting in the
windy dishevelment, as they stooped and clutched the
gowns that were lifted from their ankles as the warm,
seductive winds blew in. And it must be confessed
that many maids who delighted in brown stockings
would sit out on the shore reefs purposely to court the
flirtatious of the winds as the handsome native youths
passed by.</p>

<p class='c009'>Though I have recorded the aforesaid incidents, they
appear trivial enough when I think of the wonders of
pagan life and the poetic mystery of a South Sea forest
that flashes on the inward eye. I myself have more
than once completely lost my civilized individuality and
become part of the South Sea forest scene. I remember
that O Le Langi once took me away to a secret witch-hut
in the forest near Mootua. Sunset had already
thrown the silent wooded depths into deep shadow when
Langi, who was creeping along just ahead of me, heard
a suspicious noise, and suddenly stood perfectly still:
his tattooed wrinkled form had become a part of the
forest! his arms instinctively bent, twisted at the
elbows, represented two short, broken branch stumps.
Lo! he was no longer O Le Langi, but was a gnarled
spotted tree-trunk with blinkless eyes and carved to
resemble man, apparently lifeless, as he stood with ears
alert among the aged banyan stems! Well, just as
Langi’s primitive instincts came to his assistance and
made him unrecognizable, I too have become a part of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>the forest. I do not say that I have turned into a human
tree-stump; but I have stood alone in the silent depths
and felt my inner life become one with the old trees
around me. It was as though my conscious life was
splashed in spiritual colours over the leaves. I felt some
old sense exude from my being, like warm blood, and
dye the forest depth with the sunset’s golden glory and
poetic mystery that lay hushed on the branched luxuriant
tropical growth about me.</p>

<p class='c009'>Of O Le Langi’s musical ability I can say but little.
It would require a genius to describe the universal music
of his gifts. He was a true primitive literary man and,
therefore, like most true literary men, was a musician in
the deeper meaning of that word. Langi could hear the
grandeur of Creation’s harmony and that still, small
voice of humanity that cannot possibly express itself by
fiddling on catgut or blowing on brass. I can only say
that Langi wrote a great symphony that my memory has
vainly striven to play in these after years. The memory
of his face and deep-set, poetic eyes seems to me as of
some weird, conscious embodiment of all the sublimity
of the rugged mountains and sunlit palms, the unheard
harmonies of the moon-ridden seas and lagoons from
Samoa to the Solomons, and again from Fiji to Tahiti
and the far-off Poutomous. Those old forests are, to
me, O Le Langi’s now dead whitening bones, where
through the warm sea-winds whistle wonderful legends
that his tongue once uttered forth.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was years after that I went to Apia again and stood
by his grave. It is situated by Safata village. I noticed
that they had placed a wooden cross over the spot, and
on it was written:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line in13'>“Here lies O Le Langi.</div>
      <div class='line in14'>Died Feb. 14, 1908.”</div>
      <div class='line'>“Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>He had undoubtedly been buried by the residential
ecclesiastics; and the spiritual text chosen by them for
his memorial cross showed, to me at least, that missionaries
often speak great truths about dead men.</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c009'>I had it in my mind to finish this chapter with a critical
discourse on native and European styles of music; but
I feel that I am not able to do the subject justice. I am
too liable to be influenced by the maze of melodies that
are always playing in the great invincible orchestral
world of my memory. There are some, too, who would
consider my taste for music decidedly vulgar. Indeed,
one night, whilst stopping at an old inn on my north-west
travels, I heard a barrel-organ being played outside
on the main country road. Looking out of the window,
I saw a melancholy-visaged, white-whiskered, weird-looking
foreigner turning the handle of a derelict barrel-organ
that stood on one leg. It was an old melody
that it played, a ballad that I had been familiar with
in my childhood. Its dismal groan thrilled my soul.
It took me across the years! I heard the laughter of
my brothers and sisters and the forgotten strummings
of the old piano. The old inn was transmuted—it stood
on the grey night-hills of another age. I peeped through
the window-blind and saw that weird old organ-grinder,
just visible by the mingy gleam of the one lamp-post’s
flickering light. He had a strange look about him. He
wore a most suitable slouched hat, too! He seemed to
me some ambassador of Fate who had been sent out of
the night to appeal to my soul. I fancied that the stars
and the moon went round as he turned that handle.
“Play on! Play on!” I gasped mentally; and so the
vision of sight and sound continued, yes, as I listened
to the grand opera of my existence. The semi-sad, half-gay
ballad that he played touched my heart-strings; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>stars waved bright hands, dead laughter and beautiful,
half-forgotten voices of long ago murmured to the wailing
accompaniment of the poplar-trees that surely sighed
over old memories just across the road. I even saw
the ghost of the little, curly-headed Italian troubadour
girl creep into our old front garden again, and once
more commence to play “Santa Lucia” on her accordion.
What <i>maestro</i> ever played as soulfully as she played
for my ears?—Her voice? Oh, music inexpressibly
beautiful! Ah, the cleverness of that surreptitious
special smile for me, as she peered sideways through
her thrush-brown tresses up at our castle window! I
thought of my passion for her, of my betrothal to that
pretty, red-rose-lipped vagabondess of the south when I
was ten years old; of my austere father’s wrath when
our plans for the elopement were discovered, of my
mother’s horror—and of my shame! Alas! Let men
and women go to the grand opera, let the mighty
cathedral organs of the world thunder and moan till
their hearts are touched; but oh, give me a one-legged
barrel-organ under the poplar trees outside the window
of some old inn—playing “Santa Lucia” after dark!</p>

kindred tastes and mutual cashlessness was the direct
cause of our forming a trio for troubadour purposes.
To our great satisfaction, we came across another who
was in a hard-up state: he was a derelict Yankee sailorman,
and he told us he had been an operatic singer in
his youth. Whether he strayed from the truth in swearing
that he had charmed select audiences by his vocal
accomplishments, I cannot say. I <i>do</i> know that, when
he sang, his peculiar twang and extraordinary facial
contortions at our wandering concerts amply made up
for the disinteresting drone of his wheezy voice. He
accompanied Giovanni and myself on our wanderings
for many miles, as we visited Savaii Isle and the old
townships, Palaulae, Asaua, Matautu, Safune, Monono,
also Sufatea, and all the important native villages.
Our Yankee comrade’s swashbuckling deportment at our
numerous engagements at the high-class native <i>fale-po-ula</i>
(court dance houses) caused Giovanni and myself a good
deal of embarrassment. The fact is that his facial contortions
and voice seemed to appeal especially to the
seasoned shellbacks and traders who congregated outside
<span class='pageno' id='Page_239'>239</span>the grog-shanties as we stood beneath the palms and sang
and played on our instruments. And if it is a complimentary
sign to have had a large bouquet in the shape of a
putrid crab put into the collecting calabash-dish at our
great mixed concert-festival down at Apia, then, all I
can say is that the mêlée that followed the aforesaid
donation was a decided success. Anyhow, Billy-goat
whiskers, for so we called him, was not to blame. He
was the natural child of a vast Republic that has no
historical, dynastic background such as the Samoans
and most of the South Sea races can claim in their
history. Consequently Billy-goat whiskers had based all
his ideas and ideals on the tinker-president-everyman-as-good-as-another
creed, and he was a fine specimen of
the Yankee swanker. The American is unborn who
could imitate the splendid bearing that distinguishes a
Fijian or Samoan chief. Most of the savage races have
a splendid historical and legendary background that has
influenced their actions from earliest childhood, much
the same as French boys are influenced by the elegant
bearing and gallant manners of the characters in their
country’s historical novels, such as Dumas’ works, etc.
And so our Yankee’s apparently vulgar ways were only
the perfectly natural expression of a great democracy
that has grown out of the soul of the people. But our
pal was a brave, right down good fellow. His one fault
was rum and gin. He carried his rum-flask, beard-comb,
and pack of cards in a large handkerchief that was
emblazoned with the stars and stripes. He had short,
supple legs, and could suck his big toe like a baby. I can
swear to that peculiarity of his, for when he had a touch
of the D.T.’s he sat up in bed the whole night long and
made a most irritating noise while using his big toe as
a dummy in lieu of whisky. But, withal, it is not my
intention to write about our Yankee comrade. I will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>just finish him off by saying that it was he who introduced
us to Rajah Barab the Mohammedan. Rajah
Barab was a Malayo-Indian. He had once lived in
German New Guinea, but for sound reasons had
hastily migrated to Samoa. He lived just outside
Apia.</p>

<p class='c009'>Though this Mohammedan’s dwelling looked like some
three-roomed cow-shed, it was really the deserted ancestral
hall of the great chief O Le Sula Motavia, a
heathen divine who had had his skull blown off in the
tribal war of 1885. This dwelling was situated about
two miles south-west, on the slopes of Vaea and not so
far from Robert Louis Stevenson’s old home, Vailima.
And while O Le Sula Motavia slept on in his cold bed
within eight yards of his ancestral front door, with the
large orange tree spread above, and the blue jungle
flowers blowing over him, Rajah Barab, the sinful
Mohammedan, sat in Motavia’s old halls drinking deeply,
as warm-eyed native girls danced and sang before him.
Now this old heathen’s homestead had not been turned
exactly into a <i>tambu-house</i> after the New Guinea style,
for Barab had no idols within. But, to make up for
those wooden images that were usually carved so as to
express a heathen’s ideas of Venus and jovial Bacchus,
Barab himself would stand erect so that the native
maidens could worship the light of his living eyes and
kneel in complete obeisance at his sandalled feet. He
made a fine idol. He was a tall, broad-shouldered sinner.
He wore a richly-coloured turban and waist-swathing
which he well knew pleased the eyes of romantic Samoan
girls. Perhaps his chief adornment was his long iron-grey
beard. He swore by it and pulled it thoughtfully
when he appeared to meditate over his infinite wisdom.
And when he squatted half-erect on his fibre mat before
the admiring, awestruck maids, his eyes had a far-away
<span class='pageno' id='Page_241'>241</span>gaze in them that seemed to have kinship with the <i>vers
libre</i> and the poetic grin that enshrined his ugly mug. I
say “mug” because it resembled the rim of a mug, and
did not look like a human mouth at all. And <i>I</i> should
know, because I was a witness of his far-away-looking
gaze and poetic grin, for I dined with him. Truth to tell,
Rajah Barab had plenty of cash, and so Giovanni and
myself, both in a cashless state, were compelled to accept
the liberal fee which he offered us should we perform on
our instruments at one of his special Mohammedan festivals.
Our Yankee friend was down with the delirium
tremens at Apia at the time. It was unfortunate, because
I know that he would have been a great help to us that
night.</p>

<p class='c009'>When Giovanni and I arrived at the festival in question
there were several young Indian bloods present
amongst the visitors. It was a select gathering, inasmuch
as Barab had invited only those whose sensual
desires were akin to his own. The moon was well up,
and not only were the palms visible around his tambu-temple,
but also the native maids who danced beneath
them. Ava and gin were plentiful. Barab stood under
the large palm tree, pulling his revered beard and swearing
by his Malayan gods and Allah as he watched the
scene. As Giovanni rippled pizzicatos from his guitar
and I played my violin, we watched the scene with
intense interest. There was something phantom-like
about the whole business as the girls danced amongst
the gnarled pillars of that primitive forest-hall of giant
trees. The native girls, who had stolen away from the
solicitude of the missionaries, gave muffled screams of
delight and did such high kicks that the coco-nut-oil
lamps swayed violently. I might say that these lamps
hung from the palm branches that were immediately
over the dancers’ heads. One maid was decidedly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>attractive. Her name was Barbarossa. She was tastefully
arrayed in some diaphanous material that reached
down to her ankles. Flowers bedecked her thick, wavy
hair that rolled loose over her neck and shoulders.
Moonlight somehow intensified the musical rhythm and
charm of her form, as she swerved in many semi-barbarian
postures. While all this was going on, Barab
squatted on his old coco-nut-fibre mat, his body erect.
His pose was that of an Indian seer, and the chant that
he mumbled added to the peculiar weirdness of the
scene. Even the low-caste Samoans, who stood aside
watching the performance, called out, “Talofa! Talofa!”
demanding an encore when Barbarossa finished her
dance. As soon as the dance was over, someone banged
a drum, and that barbarian thump seemed to echo in
my heart and made me drop my fiddle, so startled was
I. For though my kind ancestors handed down to me
a pair of rose-coloured spectacles so that I might see
life as they saw it, they also presented me with a nervous
temperament; consequently anything of a sudden surprise
is peculiarly hateful to me. This inherited nerve of mine
was possibly the cause of my accepting the drink of gin
and lime-juice that Barab so artfully offered to Giovanni
and myself as we sat that night at the festival board of
his tambu-harem. Giovanni sat beside Barbarossa, and
I sat right opposite them. I was wedged in by Barab on
one side of me and a Malay Chinaman on the other side.
I confess here that I felt the degradation of my position,
and can assume from that fact that I must have been
perfectly sober. It was a low, long table lit up by a host
of small hanging-lamps that were suspended from the
wooden ceiling by threads from sennit string. I remember
that the girls, who sat along each side, were all more
or less in a maudlin condition as the fumes of the gin and
“ava” rose to their weak, feminine brains. My memory
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>is a brilliant one! I distinctly recall the wonder and
feverish look that shone in their dark eyes as the glasses
clinked, when Barab and the few remaining young bloods
of his kidney roared forth toasts to their beauty. I even
remember the smell of the Chinaman who sat next to
me. You can always smell a Chinaman; it is a peculiar
odour that suggests something between orange-pekoe
and chloroform, and is not absolutely offensive unless
you happen to be chewing delicate food when he is by.
As the maids drank on, Barab grew extremely excited,
and banged his fists on the low table in some wild delight
of anticipation. Poor Giovanni had fallen madly in
love with Barbarossa. The fact was only too evident
by all that he did. True enough, Barbarossa was the
queen of the evening. As she sat there at the table, her
eyes ashine and her loosened tresses stirred by the
scented winds that blew through the open doorway,
she looked out of place amongst the other thick-lipped,
sensual-looking girls. It was very evident, by the look
in Barab’s eyes, that he regarded her as the <i>pièce de
résistance</i> of that festival meeting. However, Giovanni
was handsome and Barab’s chances were small. Giovanni
was evidently not letting the grass grow under his feet.
I shall simply state that he behaved like the true Italian
cavalier that he was, and that I more than once lifted
my glass and drank secretly to my pal’s success in his
romantic courtship. I felt a bit muddled, it was all so
unexpected and sudden. At that time I was not aware
that Barab’s festival programme was to get the girls
quite drunk and then close and tightly bolt the door of
his tambu-house. I really thought that he had taken
a violent fancy to Barbarossa and intended to offer her
his swarthy hand in marriage according to the Malay
Mohammedan rites. I must admit that I was not at
all aware of the Malay Mohammedan marriage rite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>procedure when one of the sect took a fancy to a certain
maid. I know that Barbarossa was an innocent girl.
I discovered afterwards that she had been enticed to
attend that festival by a dissolute native missionary
who had accepted a large bribe from Barab. Just as
there are dissolute houses in European cities, where men
indulge in the white-slave traffic, so were there establishments
for trafficking purposes in Samoa, and Barab’s
house was one of them. When Giovanni and I saw
through the drift of the whole vile business, we determined
that pretty Barbarossa should not fall into Barab’s
clutches if we could help her. We both knew that Barab
had a bad reputation; and, though he was our host and
had paid us well, our self-respect should have prevented
us from accepting his money. But it must be confessed
here that Giovanni and I were not to be numbered
amongst those virtuous folk who would rather die than
sell their honour. Alas, many and many a time I would
much rather have sold my honour than nearly died!
The best of men have their weaknesses. I know that
even that dear old tattooed clergyman, O Le Langi, had
often fallen before the lure of a few half-crowns when
victuals were scarce.</p>

<p class='c009'>As soon as the festival itself was finished, Giovanni
and I stole outside the tambu-house and talked the
matter over. In a very little time we had decided to
secure Barbarossa’s person by force sooner than she
should fall into Barab’s hands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Ah, comrado, he cursed una vipera!” said my Italian
chum. Then he looked at me sadly and said: “Will you
stick to me, and mine friend be?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“I will!” I responded most emphatically. Giovanni
was a big lump of a fellow and had courage written in
the light of his magnificent eyes; also, the idea of
rescuing Barbarossa from her peril suited my temperament
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>exactly. We counted out the cash that Barab
had given us directly the feast was over, then we looked
significantly at each other, for he had paid us several
marks more than were due to us. “He wants to get
rid of us at once, no doubt of that,” was my reflection,
as I looked at Giovanni’s handsome face and then on
the moonlit solitude of the mountain slopes around dead
Motavia’s old homestead. Then we walked back,
treading very softly through the jungle as we approached
the tambu shed. Already the small lamp-lights on the
palms and within those wooden walls were burning low.
We listened, and heard the low wail of some Malayan
chanty; then the drunken song ceased.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s that?” whispered Giovanni. The door had
suddenly opened, and we saw two of the young bloods
departing. Off they went, with three drunken native
girls staggering between them. So brilliant was the
light of the moon that we distinctly observed the girls’
faces as they tossed their legs and shook the brass arm-lets,
and kissed the shoulders of the men who were
leading them away. As soon as the men were out of
sight we listened again. All was quiet; it was evident
that most of the girls who remained within the tambu
had fallen off into drunken slumber. Barbarossa had
sung her swan-song (so thought Rajah Barab). We
heard a click; the Rajah had closed the door and bolted
it! That much we discovered as we crept around the
walls of that den and endeavoured to see what was going
on within.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Wait a bit!” said Giovanni, as we suddenly heard
someone commence to drone out a weird heathen
melody. It was a girl’s voice. Then all was silent
again. We both knew that Barab would soon be drunk
and in a suitable condition for our immediate desires,
and so we strolled up and down under the palms. Then
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>we heard the <i>O Le mao</i> commence to sing somewhere
up in the lime trees.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s pretty silent now; that bird wouldn’t sing if
there were any suspicious noises about,” said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Yes, comrade, ’tis so,” whispered Giovanni, pushing
his curls off his forehead and puffing his cigarette.
I noticed that his lips were tightly set as he swung his
huge, knotted stick to and fro and gave swift glances
towards the dark-walled homestead before us. Then
we slowly crept towards the den again. The brilliant
moonlight lit up the thatched roof and sent a ghostly
glimmering all along the front of the bamboo verandah.
I was standing just over old chief Motavia’s grave;
the moonbeams were softly falling through the branches
of the orange tree and had spread a silver radiance on
my feet, which stood close to the wooden cross that said:
“Here lies the brave chief, O Le Sula Motavia.” I felt
sad to think how soundly dead men slept. I knew how
handy that chief would have been to us that night, how
gladly he would have jumped from his slumber to help
us to repel the base intruder from his old homestead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on!” I whispered to Giovanni, as we brushed
the ferns aside and stole softly towards the single window
of the den. In a moment we were both eagerly peering
through the lattice-work of the wide, low window-hole.
It was a true South Sea magic casement that opened on
the feathery foam of palms, leafy tamanu, and <i>masa’ oi</i>
trees which grew right up to the mountain slopes. There
was something fairy-like but tragic in the silent moonlit
scene outside that window. But the most wonderful
sight to be seen through the casement was the scene
before our eyes as we both stared between the twisted
wicker-work and saw behind the shutter into the gloom
of that room. There sat Rajah Barab, quite visible by
the dim light of the hanging roof oil-lamp. He was so
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>drunk that he could hardly stoop forward to pull off his
sandals. Two of the young bloods still remained, but,
to our relief, we noticed that they were prone, quite
drunk. Pretty Barbarossa, Maroa, Niue, Singa Saloo,
Fae moa Oi, and Winga, the native missionary’s daughter—and
who was not a day older than fourteen years—lay
on the mats in deep slumber. I know that my heart
echoed the sigh that Giovanni gave, as, with eyes glued
to the casement, we gazed in mute astonishment. There
lay the victims of the Mohammedan’s gold, <i>vers libres</i>,
and hyprocrisy. No sign of vice was expressed on the
girls’ faces as they lay there, their bodies half-couched in
the flood of moonlight that fell across the corner of the
room. The sham jewellery that had evidently tempted
them was distinctly visible—bangles on their legs, arm-lets
on their arms. Two or three had silk handkerchiefs
of brilliant colours about their throats, the ends tied
bow-wise, native-fashion, in the folds of their much-disordered
hair. The heat was terrific. A few fireflies
had entered the room. We distinctly saw them gleam
and flash as they danced like miniature starry constellations
over the prone forms of the girls. In the
helpless abandonment of their drink-enforced slumber,
their limbs were thrown about in the various attitudes
of restless sleep. Three of the girls lay with their arms
half-entwined, as though in some swift realization and
fright over their position they had clung to each other
ere they fell and lost consciousness. “Cara, bellissima!”
Giovanni breathed forth as he gazed on Barbarossa’s
slumbering abandonment. Her pretty blue robe was disarranged,
revealing the curves of one tiny ankle; her
olive-hued heel was visible too, for the ribbon had become
loose, the tiny sandal had fallen half off.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Mia bella! mia bellissima!” whispered Giovanni, as
he gazed in romantic rapture on her form. “Yes, she
<span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>must be saved,” I said, as Giovanni murmured on in his
musical, impassioned language, saying things that needed
no translation for my sympathetic ears and eyes! No
shame have I in writing down these things for the eyes
of whoever may wish to read. I think, if anything,
that my thoughts were less creditable than Giovanni’s.
My Italian comrade was in love, but where was the
excuse for my own impassioned glance? Why should
the curves of an ankle haunt my dreams for days?
But let it pass. There are many who may understand
and forgive. A maiden’s ankle, a tress of hair, a side
glance from lustrous eyes, a ribbon round a throat, have
turned the good thoughts of many a man from the immediate
matter in hand. Just beside the large calabash
and overturned pickle barrel lay Barbarossa’s boon friend,
Mademoiselle Singa Saloo; and the helpless abandonment
of her sensuous beauty expressed a fascinating twinship
with all that Barbarossa’s enforced recumbency revealed.
It seemed that even the moon would abet the inquisitiveness
of our curious eyes, for its light streamed
through the chinks of the bolted door and so revealed
the dusky beauty of the girls’ faces. The cool night
winds swept down the mountain slopes, stirred the palms
that silently threw their shadows over the wooden walls
and along the floor where Barab’s huddled victims lay.
Lying there, victims of Barab’s peculiar desires, they
looked like big sleeping babies. One had her arm outstretched
as though she knew the limpness of death,
while the other hand pillowed her head. Only the faint
flutter of her delicate blue throat-kerchief, following
the regular intervals of her breathing, told that life
existed.</p>

<p class='c009'>Barab had risen to his feet. His eyes shone with some
terrible light as he gazed on the helpless girls. “By
the gods of Olympus!” blurted out Giovanni as a puff
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>of wind blew his hat off. The Mohammedan had lifted
a goblet of liquor to his lips. We saw him sway violently
as he drank. “He’s half-seas-over!” was my
joyful comment. He had drawn himself erect and had
passed his hand across his brow as though he would
muster up his drowsy senses. Suddenly one of the girls
in the farther corner lifted her head and looked about
her with vacant eyes. She lifted one hand and swayed
it as though she were dreaming that she conducted some
musical chant in her native village. She staggered to
her feet. Giovanni and I watched, breathless, in our
excitement and intense curiosity. What was she going
to do? Had she in that moment realized the degradation
of her position, and would she attempt to escape? Our
very breath frightened us as it stirred the slender vine
leaves that clustered there by our open mouths and eyes
as we stared through the casement. The girl was staggering
across the room, making for Barab. He stood
erect, his turban askew, one swarthy hand holding his
beard as if he had the impertinence to pose for the
occasion. We saw the girl’s bare feet slip on the wooden
floor as she lurched to his side and gave him a drunken
leer! “Well now!” was our only comment, as she
tossed her left leg till the brass bangles that encircled her
limbs jingled!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh, handsome Mohamy clergyman!” she babbled.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Phew!” was our simultaneous ejaculation, when she
lifted her face and kissed Barab’s shoulder! Such a
look in a man’s eyes I had never seen before. The girl
had embraced him, her head was nursed in the folds of
his beard. She had commenced to sing some weird
heathen melody or chant, the chorus of the strain she
had doubtless been singing ere she lost consciousness.
There was something indescribably weird in the sounds
of her muffled voice as she still sang on, her mouth buried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>deep in the bushy growth of that Islamic beard! Barab
seized her and was about to lead her from the room into
the inner chamber wherein Giovanni and I had not been
invited to enter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now’s the time! Come on!” said I, as Giovanni
nudged me in the ribs to intimate that he had successfully
placed his arm through the window-hole and pulled
the door-bolt back! Crash! The door opened and swung
violently to and fro, so fierce had been my thrust as
I threw my whole weight against it. In a moment Barab
let the girl drop to the ground and turned towards us.
The muscles stood out on his swelling throat like whipcord.
He had whipped his <i>kris</i> from beneath his jerkin.
“<i>Iîu tidak baik Tûan!</i>” (this is not friendly of
you), he roared, as we stood before him. Then he
noticed the look in our eyes, and yelled “<i>Tôtong!</i>”
(help) at the top of his voice. Fast asleep in the corner
of the room lay two young bloods, Malays. In a moment
they had leapt to their feet. The immediate outlook
was pretty dark for Giovanni and me. We possessed no
firearms at all. In a moment I placed my rose-coloured
spectacles on, so to speak, then, bang! it went. And the
reader can rest assured that that Islamic cranium received
such a thump that its scheming interior was out of action
for some time. My violin case was broken, cracked
down the whole length. I cared not. I carefully laid
it down by the door in readiness for my coming hasty
exit. Giovanni, who was taking no risks, lifted the
wooden table and let it drop most artistically on to
Barab’s prostrate form. “Allow me!” said I, then I
lifted the large calabash of pickle oil and dashed the
whole thing in the face of the young blood who had come
to tackle me. Then the left cheek of the other one
received an Olympic punch from Giovanni. And then, as
carefully as possible, I, according to the Scriptures, smote
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>him on the right cheek as he turned towards me. By
this time the native girls had staggered to their feet and
were staring about them, rubbing their eyes as though
they had risen in astonishment to the trump of the resurrection.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Quick! out with her!” I said.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a moment Giovanni and I had grabbed Barbarossa
by the arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aue! Aue! seo, levu!” she wailed, as she looked
around her in wonder.</p>

<p class='c009'>But still we dragged her on by the arms. As I rushed
back into the den to seize my violin, the large table was
already being lifted towards the roof as the stricken
Barab heaved his back up! He was roaring forth
terrible oaths in Malayan lingo as I once more made
a hurried exit. Barbarossa’s dishevelled tresses were
streaming to the caress of the night wind when I got
outside. In a moment I had once more gripped her
arm. Arriving at the top of the slope Giovanni shook
her rather roughly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Barbarossa, remember!” he whispered.</p>

<p class='c009'>For a moment she stared vacantly at us, and then
cried, “Aue! Aue!” and to my intense relief voluntarily
gripped our arms as we ran down the slopes.
Barbarossa became our eager guide after that. And
though it is years ago now, I can still hear the sounds
of her feet pattering like falling rain over the dead leaves
of the forest ferns as we follow her across the wild
country to Mootuoa. Again Giovanni and I lift the
coco-nut-shell goblets and drink a toast with the big
tattooed chief who is Barbarossa’s father. For Barbarossa
took us safely into her village that night. And
when the old chiefs and their womenkind heard about
Barab’s sinful ways and of our blessed missionary work,
they swore to club Barab, and cheered us exceedingly.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>But alas! I lost my dear chum Giovanni. For I composed
and performed a special betrothal chant, playing
it at the festival that made Giovanni Barbarossa’s legitimate
tribal <i>fiancé</i>. And was he faithful to the Samoan
maid? I know not. But, still, I do know that Giovanni
was young and romantic. And I would not be surprised
if, as the years rolled by Barbarossa was happy, and
little children who could speak both Italian and Samoan
romped about her knees. Fine children too, I should
think, from such a splendid combination from the two
romantic lands of the Sunny South.</p>

<p class='c009'>Such was my personal experience of the Samoan
Brown-Slave Traffic. And I might say, it is an experience
that I have considerably toned down in the aforesaid
narrative. As I have already intimated, I have
included this experience here only that my readers may
have a view of both sides of native life, and realize
that native girls and women are subject to the temptations
of sensualists much the same as their sisters in the
large cities of the civilized world. And I would say
that it is a pleasure for me to be able to record here
that Barab’s dwelling was razed to the ground by the
wrathful chiefs of Barbarossa’s village. True enough, it
was really the last homestead of that brave old chief
O Le Matavia; but he was a good and holy heathen.
And so one might well imagine that the flames of his
corrupted ancestral halls gave cheerful warmth to his
ghost and cold bones as he slept on under the orange-tree,
just outside.</p>

<p class='c009'>And what became of Barab the Mohammedan? All
I can say is, the good work that Giovanni and I began
was finished off by the missionaries. Barab was expelled
from Samoa, and hastened seaward, doubtless to seek
fresh converts for his creed in other lands.</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>After losing Giovanni’s welcome companionship, I felt
very lonely, and so decided to go seaward again. Though
I was not a sailor by profession, it was always an easy
matter for me to get a ship. I think I had an ingratiating
way with me when I approached the mates and skippers.
And when I came across a skipper or mate with a face
like cast-iron and eyes like a shark’s, which I often
did, I changed my tactics. For I approached him with
my violin in one hand and a bottle of the best Hollands
in the other hand. I invariably found that, if music
does not soothe the savage breast, Hollands gin comes
pretty near the mark. Anyway, I got a berth and sailed
before the mast outbound for old Tai-o-hae, Nuka Hiva.
I had been to the Marquesas many times, but in the next

  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c018'>I&nbsp;RECALL the memory of a Marquesan royal person
who stands out in my recollection with unusual vividness.</p>

<p class='c009'>Whilst wandering, during one of my troubadouring
expeditions north-west of Tai-o-hae, I came across a
small, semi-pagan, tribal citadel of huts on the lower
mountain slopes. It was a romantic and picturesque
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>scene. The scattered bird-cage huts, made of twisted
bamboo and nestling in the hollows, that were shaded
by feathery palms, intensified the enchantment of the
secluded forest empire. I know that the glad reception
which I received from the whole population when I
entered the high bamboo stockade gate, my two native
boys ahead of me, was as impressive as it was pleasing
to me. The two boys in question were Palao and Sango,
neither of them more than ten years of age. But they
were invaluable guides, considering the benefit their protection
afforded my unarmed person, for they were able
to converse in the difficult Marquesan tongue, and could
explain my wishes and friendly attributes.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was always careful in those days, and contrived
that Palao and Sango should move ahead of me as my
advance guard, thus leaving me in the immediate rear,
ready for flight. The tribes about that part were supposed
to be friendly, but my nerves were a bit unsettled
through hearing that two sailors had been murdered in
a tribal village ten miles to the eastward. Indeed, more
than once I had been welcomed by the sudden appearance
of fierce warriors with raised war-clubs and other strange
implements of combat, which gave due notice that intruders
were not to call at that particular moment!
Possibly a tribal battle had been on, and had ended in
the demise of a young warrior or so, and consequently
a happy cannibal festival was in progress. Hence, no
admission to the tribal stronghold for white men unless
they happened to call on the most secretive and intimate
terms.</p>

<p class='c009'>Seeing only the smiling faces of chiefesses and chiefs
welcoming me from the ambush of multi-coloured flowers
by the lagoon mangroves, I saw that I had arrived at
an opportune moment. “Aloah! Alli, Papalagi!” came
from the lips of the assembled natives as I placed my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>violin to my chin and commenced to perform an old
Marquesan <i>himine</i>.</p>

<p class='c009'>The effect was magical: out of the leafy shadows
and the hut doorways rushed the whole population, so
it seemed to me, their faces bright with delight. It was
a sight worth travelling many miles to see: tawny, oval,
elongated, scarred, serious, and handsome faces, with
original-looking eyes of varied brilliance, stared at me.
A few tattooed warriors, clad in lava-lava and palm-leaf
head-gear, leaned against the coco-palm stems regarding
me with fixed, cynical-looking eyes. I did not like
the look of them at all, but they turned out to be harmless
enough. They were simply the old conservatives
of heathen times, who instinctively resented the intrusion
of white men into their sylvan demesne. Flocks of pretty
boys and girls, of a pale walnut-polished hue, clambered
at the picturesque <i>ramias</i> (native skirts) of their deep-bosomed
mothers, gazing with half-frightened stare as
my violin bow swept forth the wailing strains. I must
have looked like some Pied Piper as I marched across
the wide <i>rara</i> (village green), with Palao and Sango
singing lustily, one on each side of me. That pagan
mountain village was part of a true wonderland of the
wine-dark seas. I am unable to describe the bright-eyed
glances of those pretty Nausicaas and Circés who crept
from the Elysium-like shadows of heathenland and stared
at me as I passed by. Two stalwart chiefs, who were
nibbling my present of tobacco plug, led the way; they
were taking me straight to the palace building wherein
dwelt their tribal queen. This palatial stronghold was
constructed of coral stone and was surrounded by a wide
verandah that was again sheltered by the beautiful
pauroa and tamunu trees. Entering the palace, I found
myself in a low-roofed apartment. On the walls hung
the polished skulls of fallen warriors who had been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>renowned for bravery in their day. Magnificently woven
tappa-mats covered the polished floors and the barbarian
furniture. I noticed two cases of gin and one empty
rum barrel standing right in the centre of the apartment.
They were given that conspicuous position, I believe, because
rum and gin denoted all that was immense wealth
in the eyes of the Marquesan race. But what struck
me as the most interesting piece of barbarian antiquity
was the strange woman who presided over that palatial
residence. She looked as old as her palm-clad native
hills, and I discovered that she was one of the surviving
queens of the many who had once reigned over the small
dynasties of the Marquesan group. I had never seen her
like before; her physiognomy was unique and decidedly
pleasing-looking. She might easily have been some happy
personification of Death itself as she sat there and
saluted me:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Aloah! Papalagi, you wanter see me am?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oui! Aloah Majesty Imperialess,” I responded, as
I made an effort and bowed the knee to her. I had
visited Queen Vaekehu, who still reigned supreme in her
old age down on the lower slopes by Calaboose Hill, and
so I knew how to gain the appreciation of those heathen
ex-Queens. Vaekehu was a masterpiece in the tattoo line,
but I can assure you that ex-Queen Loi Vakamoa,
for the sheer hieroglyphic-tattooed beauty that adorned
her limbs and shoulders, could stand unrivalled throughout
the North and South Pacific.</p>

<p class='c009'>After addressing me, she left her squatting-mat just
by her gin barrel, and majestically mounted what I imagine
was her throne (a lot of old sea-chests and gin-cases
covered with tappa-cloth). I did my level best
to make myself pleasant, played the violin, drank some
bitter stuff, and took a keen interest in all she said.
Sitting up there on her old box throne, her profile reminded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>me of those old-fashioned engravings of Queen
Elizabeth of England. The sensual curves, once so pronounced,
had shrunk with her lips; but the beak-like nose—tattooed
with tiny semi-circles from the bridge down
to the cheeks—gave her a somewhat melancholy aspect.
The only perceptible determinedness of the face was the
sharp outline of the nose, which somehow suggested that
its owner would meet the accumulating calamities of age
with commendable aggressiveness. Yet her demeanour
was affable in the extreme. Never before had I beheld a
face that so sadly expressed the aftermath of all that
had been and at the same time told of a bitter forlornness
through senescence of frame and mind. The
devious shruggings of her shoulders, the pathetic semi-amorous
glances, and the many hints that she gave whilst
striving to convince me of her once mighty Queenship
and physical beauty, were positively painful to my mind.
After giving me a goblet of whisky and lime-juice, which
I must admit was refreshing, we seemed to become more
confidential with each other. She took Palao by the
arm and got him to tell her where he had met me, and
much that I, of course, could not make out. By many
direct hints she let me know that she had enjoyed a vast
plurality of husbands.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I been wifer to many kinks!” she said.</p>

<p class='c009'>Most of what she said was translated to me by Palao
as I politely sipped the peculiar beverage that she herself
handed me. I hardly knew which way to glance as she
gabbled on and Palao translated and I listened. Suddenly
she acquainted me with the fact that she had been
wedded more than twice to white men of distinction!
She saw the look of surprise on my face. Perhaps she
thought I doubted her, for she lifted the lid of a small
sandal-wood box and brought forth a yellowish, very
faded sheet of foolscap paper.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>“Savvy, Papalagi?” she almost whimpered, as I read
on. (And her eyes were shining with pride all the while.)</p>

<p class='c009'>And so I perused the following marriage lines:</p>

<p class='c027'>“This dokerment is to certify that Old Man
Martin Smith of Woolloomooloo, New Sarth Wales,
has from the dated day of this dokerment, 14th
Feb. 1861, become the lawful husband of Queen
Loi Vakamoa of this yere Isles and several more
isles to the sarthwards. The foresaid Queen agrees
to hand over all her monies and prufits she gits
from her copra plantations and howsomeever monies
she gits hold on whilst the aforesaid John Martin
Smith remains King. And it is agreed that John
Smith can have a safe passage in the old ship’s boat,
free from any cursed interference by the late dethroned
King Kai Le Tua Vakamoa and his b—
heathen chiefs at any such time as he wants to quit
this yere Isles and his dominions and go back to his
lawful Missus, Maltida Sarah Martin Smith of
Kansas City, Merica.</p>
<div class='c028'>“Signed by <span class='sc'>Queen</span></div>
<div class='c028'>————————— (<i>Signature</i>).</div>

<p class='c029'>“Old Man <span class='sc'>Martin Smith</span>, Bridegroom and King.</p>

<p class='c029'>“<i>Witness</i>,—<span class='sc'>Jonathan Briggs</span>, late Cook of S.S.
‘Albatross,’ who hereby claims 25 per cent. on
all profits accruing from the aforesaid wedding.”</p>
<p class='c018'>So ran the wording of all that may be published here
of John Smith’s marriage lines. My accumulated experiences
of such hearties as John Smith and Jonathan
Briggs, Esq., gave me an idea as to the fine old times
those two noble papalagis had in their sojourn on those
isles to the southward during their brief kingship. But
no hint of all I imagined was visible on my countenance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>when I handed the tattered document back to the smiling
ex-queen. At this moment a hideous, aged Chinaman
poked his face in the palace doorway and surveyed me
with surprised, yellowish, vicious eyes. I wondered who
he was, what relationship existed between him and the
Queen, that he could so impertinently thrust his ugly
physiognomy into the doorway like that. The next moment
he had gone, and I saw him no more, though I
heard him gabbling as he drove off the flocks of children
who persistently crowded by the palace door, waiting
till I should come out again. And still the Queen spoke
on. Palao patiently translated her tales of departed
lovers for my inquisitive ears. Seeing my curiosity, her
eyes gleamed with delight, her two remaining frontal
teeth, fitting fork-like into the gaps between the two
teeth of the lower jaw, gave a sardonic look to her face
as she sat there. She wore a peculiar garb too: the
remnant of some old European skirt swathed her frame,
but was cut very short, ending just above the knees.
On her head was an old hat that had once been a fashionable
Parisian bonnet. Possibly this hat had been
presented to her by one of the French officials.</p>
<p class='c009'>As I boldly surveyed her limbs she drew one tawny
finger along the faded blue curves and stripes of tattoo.
From all that she vigorously hinted, those tattoo marks
were historic representations that denoted the insignia
and coats-of-arms of the tribes wherein she had married.
“What may that mean, Palao?” I said, as I glanced
curiously at her anatomy, and observed impressionistic
figures of muscular men, some standing in a gladiatorial
attitude, spear in hand and face uplifted. And then,
listening carefully to all that Palao had to say, I made
out that they were a few of the ex-queen’s old lovers—men
who had won her love in years gone by and died
in some great tribal battle that had been led by some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>mighty chief who also yearned for her impassioned embrace!
As my faithful Palao and Sango translated these
things to me (and more than once cast their eyes in
shame to the palace floor), it seemed like a dream that
I should be standing in that coral-built place listening
to the memories that remained in that old woman’s brain.
A great deal that she said sounded to my ears “not
quite the thing.” But I am not one who is too squeamish
or critical over the moral codes that exist outside
the dominions of my own land. As she gazed up into
my face, and her aged lips quivered in the emotion she
felt over her wild reminiscences, I took the extended,
shrivelled hand, and, with some emotional idea of all
that she once had been, gallantly kissed it! After that,
her conversation suddenly changed to a subtle delivery
of phrases in pigeon English. I slowly gathered that
she was telling me of wondrous presentations she had
received from her past lovers, and how they had each
in turn recognized the great honour conferred upon them
by <i>her</i> acceptance of their manifold gifts. Before I had
gathered the true import of what she was driving at,
she was beseeching me to hand over my violin to her.
I remained obdurate. What on earth she wanted my
instrument for, Heaven knows. Possibly she was childish,
and so, like a child, would have it as a toy.</p>

<p class='c009'>She invited me to go out into the palace grounds. She
led the way. Her garden was cultivated. Pineapples,
tomatoes, taro, oranges, yams, and many tropical fruits
grew in abundance around me. By the shade of the
buttressed banyans, at the far end of the cleared space,
stood a huge wooden idol. It was a hideous thing:
one large tooth protruded from its wide, slit, crocodile-like
mouth, where in and out crawled fat insects with
tortoise-shell-hued wings (I think they were big ants).
Though the Queen wore a Catholic medallion on her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>bosom, and had told me that “She belonger Popey God,
and was all-e-samee great Cliston womans,” I distinctly
saw her aged form give a bow of heathenish reverence
as we both stood in front of that monstrous heathen
deity! It stood nearly seven feet high, and standing
there as some representation of infinity, the hopelessness
of creeds and all the ills and mockery of human
existence, it was a magnificent bit of perfection. When
we returned into the small palace, it was dusk.
“Salaba!” called Vakamoa in a wheezy voice. In a
moment I heard the shuffling of running feet, and then a
beautiful Marquesan maid, robed in tappa-cloth, flowers,
and threaded shells, appeared before me. She gazed on
me with a quizzical lustrous gleam in her eyes. This
maid interested me because of her European-like features.
I saw her place her fingers into the folds of her thick
tresses to see that the hibiscus blossoms were still tastefully
arranged, in much the same way as a vanity-stricken
English maid might do. In a few moments this serving-maid,
for such she was, lit up all the tiny hanging
coco-nut-oil lamps in the apartment, then she went away
and left Vakamoa and myself alone.</p>

<p class='c009'>Squatting on the mats, I did as she bade me, and commenced
to play my violin. She seemed very pleased
with the English melodies that I performed, and once or
twice mumbled as I played.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You liker see me dance?” she said. Then she
hummed a little <i>himine</i> and asked me to play it. Had
I not seen that old woman career round that low-roofed
chamber as she danced some old barbarian rhythm, I
would never have believed it possible. So astonished
was I, that I forgot my part of the business and stopped
playing. “Alo! Alo!” (Go on! Go on!) she said,
almost fiercely. In a moment I placed my instrument
to my chin, and once more fired away. The hanging
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>lamps along the roof-beams swayed to and fro as her
skirt swished violently, and her stiff legs made such
movements that it is impossible to describe them. “If
this is how she goes on in the dry leaf what <i>did</i> she do
in the green?” was my reflection, as her bony legs went
up with a bound, and then right over my head! I’ve
no wish to exaggerate in the description of it all; only
those who have seen the fetish frenzy of an aged barbarian
woman under the influence of whisky (for so I
concluded she must be) will know what I saw that
night! I had no alternative but to go through with it.
As she leapt over me her toes caught in my hair and
withdrew some by the roots! But I did not budge an
inch; I simply played for dear life, as it were. I knew
that she was a heathen, that she was old and childish
and not responsible for her actions. I also recalled many
things that O Le Langi had told me about heathen
women’s mad ways when they grow old and realize the
loss of their beauty. “She can’t go on much longer,”
I thought, as she bounded round the room, lifting her
scraggy arms and chanting in a weird manner. True
enough, she slowed down after the fiftieth round, and
then sat panting beside me. After that exhibition, I
did my best to keep on the right side of her. I handed
her a piece of tobacco plug that I, fortunately, had in
my pocket. And, though it was my last piece of tobacco,
I felt well repaid for its loss by the evident pleasure
the gift gave her. She immediately twisted a lump off
and placed it in her large corn-cob pipe, then struck a
match on the boniest portion of her anatomy, and started
to puff vigorously at my gift.</p>

<p class='c009'>After that I withdrew as hastily as possible from her
chamber. Palao and Sango re-entered and prostrated
themselves at her feet. This pleased her immensely.
Going down the mossy pathway that led to the stockade
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>gate, I turned my head and waved two or three farewell
salutations. The last I saw of her was as she stood
by her door, her forked teeth close together as she
grinned with pleasure at thinking I should return on the
morrow! But I did not return again. And I may say
here, that I have always felt more at ease in the presence
of old native men than in the presence of native women,
be they waiting-women or ex-queens.</p>

<p class='c009'>Before I left the immediate precincts of that bungalow,
which Vakamoa styled her “palace,” I strolled into the
tiny coral-fenced clearing by the plateau of the mountain
slopes. It was the lonely place where the tribe buried
their dead. I gazed for a little time on the strange
tomb-stones, and tried to make out the inscriptions that
apparently commemorated the past virtues of kings and
chiefs who had passed into shadowland. Notwithstanding
the feathery palms and the glimpse of the far-away,
moonlit, tumbling seas, it was a forlorn place. And
now, doubtlessly, that discarded Queen Vakamoa has long
since dissolved, with all her pride of past queenship, into
a little dust, and a lump of memorial coral tells where
she lies in that tiny, barbarian necropolis.</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c009'>Next day I accepted the invitation of Palao to stop
in his father’s bungalow near the shore. I had had
enough adventure for the time being, and so was extremely
pleased to romp with the native children and
listen to their wonderful fairy-tales. For be it noted that
those children had their Hans Andersens and Grimms,
just as we have. I’ll tell one of the stories in the next
chapter.</p>

  <h2 id='ch14' class='c007'>CHAPTER XIV. TISSEMAO AND THE CUTTLE-FISH</h2>
</div>
<p class='c017'>Impressionistic Scene in Nuka Hiva—Tissemao listens to
the Luring Voice of a Cuttle-fish—The Love-Stricken
Cuttle-fish—When Crabs are Brave.</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c008'>THE pagan city of Nuka Hiva was silent. The tired
sentinel stars were creeping homeward. Dawn had
already arisen from her silvery couch, her soft robe,
cut out of the warm western winds, wrapped around her,
her sandals dipped in light as she stood on the skyline,
a few stars still plucking her dusky hair. Then that
wonderful enchantress, who awakens the ages, stepped
tiptoe across the horizon’s shadow hills, the echoes of
her footfalls winging the silence of the tropic seas.
Those echoes, colliding with the granite hills of South
Sea fairy-land, rustled the magical shadows of the sylvan
hollows, then, touching the winged nymphs and petals
of the flamboyants and ndrala blossoms, sped onward
into the deeper glooms of the forests. An aged cockatoo
who had spent its best years as a vassal of the god
<i>Atua Mao</i>, looked sidelong at the golden gleams of the
eastern sky and called out hoarsely:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Talofa! Aloah! Awake, O birds of the forest!
Morn is here! Arise!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, all this happened in full view of a little heathen
village by a mossy slope near Tai-o-hae. And who was
it could see so strange a fairy-land in the birth of a new
day breaking across the ranges? It was Tissemao, the
Marquesan maid!</p>

<p class='c009'>Tissemao was up very early that morning. She had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>been with her little brother Noko-noko, fishing for <i>reatos</i>
in the blue lagoon by the bay. And Noko, burdened
with fishy wealth, had hurried back home to his village
hut that stood in the shadows of the mountains of
<i>Atnana</i>, leaving his sister alone. As Tissemao dangled
her feet in the cool waters of the ocean the golden light
was stealing from the eyes of sunrise; it touched the
surface of the big <i>moani ali</i> (ocean) that shone like a
mighty mirror that stretched to the horizon. Suddenly
Tissemao felt something pull at her toes which were
dangling in the sea. Looking down to see what it could
be, she gave a cry of surprise. And no wonder;
for a Cuttle-fish poked its head out of the sea, and
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m so sorry to disturb you, Tissemao, but we’ve
all been swimming about here a long time, for we can
see your shadow in the waters, and really it is very
beautiful.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Tissemao blushed to hear such praise. Looking down,
she saw that it was quite correct, for there, in the water,
shone her image as clear as though it was mirrored in
a sheet of glass. Clad in her coloured tappa <i>holaku</i>
(short chemise), hibiscus flowers in her mass of dusky
hair, she really <i>did</i> make a pretty picture.</p>

<p class='c009'>The Cuttle-fish, putting on its sweetest smile, said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Would you like to come down here and see the
wonders of the great world under the sea?”</p>

<p class='c009'>For a long time Tissemao hesitated, then she said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Why, Mr. Cuttle-fish, you must remember I’m not
like you; I should soon die for the want of breath under
the sea.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh dear, no!” said the artful Cuttle-fish, shaking
its head slowly at the idea of such a ridiculous suggestion.</p>

<p class='c009'>But very soon, hearing that there were so many strange
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>and beautiful things under the sea, Tissemao, with the
Cuttle-fish’s kind help, slid down gently into the deep
water!</p>

<p class='c009'>Directly she got beneath the surface, the Cuttle-fish
seized her tightly by the arm, and said fiercely:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on! now I’ve got you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Poor Tissemao was frightened out of her life as she
felt the clutch of the Cuttle-fish as it dragged her down,
down. It seemed such a long time ere she touched the
bottom of the ocean. Still the Cuttle-fish clutched her,
and breathed heavily, like one who had gained a rich
prize and dreaded to lose it. Dragging her along the
ocean floor, he came to a cavern. For a moment the
Cuttle-fish looked round, then took her in. This cavern
was lit up by a faint glimmer from the light of the sun
that was shining up over the sea. As Tissemao looked
round, the Cuttle-fish said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I am all that’s beautiful; if you expect to see anything
more beautiful than a cuttle-fish, you are very,
very much mistaken.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Saying this, it lifted its ugly face and tried to assume
a fascinating smile.</p>

<p class='c009'>But it was no good. Tissemao would have none of
it, but simply said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Let me get away; let me go up into my village again,
will you?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The old Cuttle-fish got into an awful rage at hearing
Tissemao plead so, for he had fallen deeply in love
with her.</p>

<p class='c009'>Now it so happened, and by the merest chance too,
that the Cuttle-fish was terrifying Tissemao, trying to
frighten her into subjection, when a very old Crab happened
to be walking by the Cuttle-fish’s cavern door.
The Crab distinctly caught sight of Tissemao looking up
with terror-stricken eyes at the Cuttle-fish.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>“Ho ho!” he muttered to himself; “so he’s at it
again, is he!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Now, this old Crab was good-hearted, one of the
respectable kind. And, knowing the reputation the
Cuttle-fish had as a <i>roué</i> of the worst type, he at once
determined to thwart the Cuttle-fish in his endeavours to
attempt to hurt so sweet a maid as Tissemao. So he
gently looked round the corner of the cavern door, and
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good afternoon.”</p>

<p class='c009'>In a moment the vicious Cuttle-fish rushed to the door,
so that its bulk could artfully hide Tissemao from the
intruder’s eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old Crab, seeing through the ruse and not wishing
to let the Cuttle-fish know that it had seen Tissemao,
artfully put its claw to its mouth, then, yawning, said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Oh dear, my eyes are so bad lately, really I can’t
see anything at all.” Then it looked straight into the
Cuttle-fish’s eyes, and continued: “I suppose you feel
very lonely here in this cave of yours?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Cuttle-fish, like all things of a wicked type, had
no brains at all, and so was completely taken in. And
the Crab, chuckling to itself, went safely on its way as
quickly as possible round the corner, to consider what
was best to do to extricate Tissemao from her awful
position.</p>

<p class='c009'>In a moment it had made its mind up. Going up to
a large cavern that stood in its own grounds to the
south-west of the mighty forests of sea-weeds, it lifted
its claws and gently knocked at the door. In a moment
it opened, and a great Sword-fish thrust its tremendous
spiked nose out, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hallo! What’s up now? I was just having a nap;
you are the second person who has knocked at my door
this afternoon and disturbed me.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>The old Crab bowed, and apologized profusely as it
saw the Sword-fish’s angry face. Then the Crab said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I have come to you, knowing well that you are a
friend of the helpless and are fair-dealing in all your
mighty battles with that weapon, that sword which is
fixed on your face.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, make haste. What is it?” said the Sword-fish,
who, being powerful, was used to soft, flattering
speeches from old crabs and other helpless things that
were at his mercy under the deep sea.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the old Crab at once told the Sword-fish all that
he had seen while he had been passing the door of the
Cuttle-fish’s cave. The Sword-fish, who was fond of
Cuttle-fish as a breakfast-dish, became most indignant
as he listened to the Crab’s comments on the morals of
the Cuttle-fish. Then, without further parley, they both
sallied forth to rescue Tissemao. Arriving outside the
cavern, the Crab gently knocked at the Cuttle-fish’s
door, as prearranged, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good evening, Mr. Cuttle-fish; I’ve called to see you
because you are so lonely.”</p>

<p class='c009'>The Cuttle-fish, who was persuading Tissemao to give
him just one kiss, rushed to the door, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Clear out of this; I’m busy.”</p>

<p class='c009'>At this, the old Crab swelled its breast out with bravery
through its knowledge that the Sword-fish was stealthily
waiting round the corner, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t you talk like that to me, you ungrateful wretch,
when I’ve come all this way to pay you a friendly visit.”
Then, losing its temper, the Crab gave a knowing wink,
and said: “I <i>know</i> all about you; you are at your old
tricks again—<i>whose</i> poor wife have you got in your house
now, I wonder?”</p>

<p class='c009'>With its eyes ablaze with rage at hearing such a suggestion
from a cowardly old crab, and in its knowledge
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>that truth was spoken, the Cuttle-fish gave a running
dash, and knocked the Crab over. This act was just
what the Sword-fish was waiting for, for as the Cuttle-fish
rushed out of the cave so as to reach the Crab, he,
too, gave a dash forward and so impaled the Cuttle-fish
on his mighty sword! In a moment the Crab had recovered
its feet, delighted at the success of its ruse. For
Tissemao kissed its ugly face as it embraced her, and
told of all it had done on her behalf. It was then that
the Crab said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Come on! Come on!”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then it escorted her along the wide floor of the deep
ocean till she reached the shore. Then it said, “Never
listen to the flattery of cuttle-fishes again, for you see
that, but for an ugly old sword-fish and a brave person
like me, you might have got out of your depth for ever.
Now then, go away, silly girl!”</p>

<p class='c009'>On hearing the Crab’s advice, Tissemao at once stepped
out of the ocean water, and saw the beautiful sun, and
thereupon made up her mind to be satisfied with the
world she knew. In a moment she had rushed off into
the forest, and back again to her native village. Her
mother was delighted to see her again. They had all
thought she was drowned, or dead somewhere in the
forest, for though she knew it not, she had been away
for three days! And, to this day, the people of those
isles to the north-west always feel kindly toward old
crabs, and look upon the big sword-fish as a valiant
warrior.</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c009'>Such was the simple heathen fairy story which was
told to me by my little comrade the Marquesan youth,
Palao, who, as the reader will recall, was a member of
my retinue when I paid a visit to the aged, discarded
Queen Vakamoa, she who had once been the unlawfully-wedded
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>wife of Old Martin Smith of New South Wales.</p>

<p class='c009'>A few days after leaving the village where my little
friend Palao lived, I secured lodgings at the primitive
inn near Tai-o-hae beach. I recall that I stayed at that
rum-stricken hostel for only a few days. The fact is,
that an extraordinary old madman dwelt in the room
next to mine. Just as I laid my weary head down and
thanked Providence in my blessed anticipation of a well-earned
month’s rest, the old man went raving mad. Why
Ranjo, my host, put up with him was a complete mystery.
Up and down the room he would tramp, never
ceasing, till he had wakened me for the night, as he called
out in a most solemn voice:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Suffered under Pontius Pilate. O the quick and the
dead! the quick and the dead!”</p>

<p class='c009'>So would he rave on for hours till, exhausted, he fell
asleep. And then he would snore, and puff the lips of
his toothless mouth about in such a terrific manner that
I dreamed that I was dead and sleeping in a deep-sea
cave where the waves rushed in and violently lifted my
shell-burred bones eternally. On the third night I was
relieved of his presence, for he rose after midnight, went
outside, and knelt before a tallow candle which he lit and
placed beneath the palm grove. He would kneel before
this humble tallow altar for about two hours, chanting
in a sombre voice the Lord’s Prayer, interspersed with
ghastly epitaphs that made my blood curdle as I groaned
on my trestle bed.</p>

<p class='c009'>I was thankful when I made the acquaintance of a
young German. I cannot wax enthusiastic over a member
of the Teutonic race, but still, I must admit, that
my German friend was as clean-minded a comrade as one
could hope to meet in the South Seas in those days.
Indeed, he and I secured a berth as stowaways on a full-rigged
windjammer, and so left Nuka Hiva, incognito,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>outbound for the glorious Nowhere of sanguine youth.
I see by my diary that I eventually arrived in New
Guinea, where I stayed six months with a celebrated high
chief and his family. Though my native host was an
inveterate cannibal in battle times, he and his family were
exceedingly kind to me while I was down with malaria.
After that I shipped on a German vessel for the Solomon
Isles, where I arrived off Bougainville in a typhoon. Our
ship was wrecked off the coast, and we lost four hands.
I had only my shirt and boots on when a huge comber
swept me from the deck into the ocean, where I seemed
to make about four somersaults between the sea and the
night sky, ere I was landed high up on the sandy beach.
Next day I recovered my violin from the wreck that lay
high and dry on the barrier reefs. Unfortunately, I have
no space to narrate all that I experienced when I became
the staunch friend of the Solomon Island head-hunters!—played
the violin to the great Ingrova, to Oom Pa, and
gave violin lessons to high chief Stem-Poo’s half-caste
daughter, Mallio-Wao, up in the mountain stronghold
at Zalabar. I will simply say, that, under the friendly
cover of one dark night, I hurriedly left Ysabel for New
Guinea, and after many wanderings once more came
across my Irish comrade, O’Hara. And in the next
chapters I will attempt to relate those things which I
count as the most thrilling experiences of wild South
Sea life which I was ever thrown into by the mystery of
circumstance.</p>

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c018'>I&nbsp;WAS hanging by one foot from a mystical cloud,
lesiurely travelling across the tropic sky, then I
lost my grip and fell! I distinctly recall the awful sensation
of that noiseless dive through space, ere I arrived
with a crash! I had apparently fallen through the roof
of a grog-shanty on a Pacific Isle. Many may doubt
the aforesaid assertion of mine, and say that such a
mishap was a physical impossibility. But I would say
that it is only the impossible that <i>does</i> occur. I felt the
spasm of that sudden headlong contact of my skull
against some hard object very acutely. Opening my
eyes I saw astonished traders standing around me, still
holding their rum mugs between the bar and their lips
as they stared, open-mouthed, down on my recumbent
form. I looked through the doorway and saw feathery
palms, and moonlit seas softly beating over the coral
reefs of a strange shore.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It looks as though I’ve fallen on another world,”
thought I. But no such luck for me! The fact of the
case is this. Our ship, from Honolulu, had arrived off
the Fiji Islands that evening. I was with O’Hara, whom
I had re-met in Hawaii. And, in my hurry to get ashore,
I had hired a canoe, and whilst I was being paddled
ashore, the canoe had turned turtle! It appeared that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>I had sunk twice beneath the water before O’Hara and
the native boatmen rescued me. They thought I was
done for when they dragged me up the shore and carried
me into the grog-shanty.</p>

<p class='c009'>The native bar-keeper had gone off immediately to
fetch a well-known Fijian medicine-man who dwelt in
Tumba-Tumba village. What on earth the medicine-man
did before he succeeded in restoring my heart-beats,
I don’t know. O’Hara swore that he delivered mighty
blows on my hips with a flat war-club, lifted me repeatedly
up to the shanty’s roof by one leg and let me drop
with a crash! The native doctor was evidently cruel
to be kind, for his strange acts saved my life, and
were the direct cause of the strange sensations and my
experience as above recorded.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the reader knows, O’Hara was an old pal of mine,
and, being an Irishman, was impulsive and entertaining.
When I was down in the mouth he proved a medicine-man
of the spirits, for he made me laugh insanely when
I was sane, and dosed me with romantic Irish songs and
rum when credit was scarce. As I have stated, it was
after leaving New Guinea that I had the good fortune
to come across my old comrade again in Honolulu.
Though I had a good musical engagement, and was getting
on in the world, so far as the world’s opinion goes,
I let everything go to the winds through not keeping a
square chin when O’Hara asked me to go a-roving with
him. As usual, he nearly succeeded in getting us both
hanged when we arrived at Apamama and I became Court
violinist to King Tembinok. It is <i>one</i> thing to be loyal
to a chum in adversity, but to be expected to do the
things that O’Hara wished me to do when Tembinok’s
tawny wife fell in love with him was quite another matter.
I remembered the Fae Fae excursion and our flight
from Tahiti.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>“No, thank you!” I said, when he had the cheek to
come and ask me——</p>

<p class='c009'>But, there, it’s not my wish to deal with that business
here. I am out to tell of quite a different adventure
that befell us after we arrived in Fiji. Financially speaking,
I had done very well in Honolulu. I had secured
a good engagement as violinist to King Laukauhammer,
as well as my salary as conductor of the royal bodyguard
band. In all I managed to save a thousand dollars.
Though I am not a man who can see anything in this
world to get a swelled head about, my vanity was considerable
when the King presented me with the Court
shield of the Kalakaua dynasty—an equivalent to the
Cross of the Chevalier of Honour—thus making my
seventh South Sea knighthood in less than twelve months,
not counting, mind you, the proffered kingship at
Temelako, New Guinea, where, on playing my violin
under a palm tree, outside a heathen seraglio, I was
embraced by a widowed queen and compelled to enter
the tribal palace palavana by royal command. Also I
had, to the King’s delight, composed special marches,
and scored them for the strange, primitive instrumentation
of the King’s private military band. For a while
I had lived sumptuously at the best hotel in Beratania
Street. Then I had decided to start off in search of any
adventure that was opposed to the orthodox route as
mapped out in the twelve commandments of civilized life.</p>

<p class='c009'>I recall that O’Hara and I sailed as first-class passengers
on the S.S. “Alameda,” which was bound for
N.S.W., via Suva, Fiji. The voyage was momentous
for its monotony, not one storm or passionate incident.
O’Hara and I cursed everything, wished the sea yellow,
the sun blue, and that the crew might mutiny and pitch the
skipper overboard or cast us adrift on endless waters.
Night after night we unbuttoned our clothes and thankfully
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>“turned in” to rehearse a death-like existence in
our small, coffin-shaped bunks. After arriving in Fiji
and those things happening already narrated, we put up
at the best hotel in Suva, scorning Smith’s bar and the
old fan-tan shanty at Buta. For a while we enjoyed
the company of the élite—well-to-do traders, ships’ mates
and derelict skippers, stranded runaway apprentices, and
strange men of better days who appeared to have lost
their memory and their reason for being in Fiji at all.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was while we were stopping at this hotel that O’Hara
and I discovered that our improvidence necessitated our
looking for cheaper diggings. An old shellback, seeing
how things were with us, took us into his confidence,
recommended us to a good lodging-house, a sort of
Sailors’ Home, on the Rewa river. First, one must know
that this Sailors’ Home was primarily the “Charity Organization
of the Southern Seas!” For, beneath its kind
roof, sheltered by giant breadfruit trees, men hid from
the Suva police—men who were mostly fugitives from
across the world, and who had flown from the cities
in haste to save their necks or their liberty. But this fact
did not deter O’Hara and myself from wishing to go
there. Personally, I have always thought that one has
a perfect right to save one’s neck. Man has only one
neck, one life, and not always one chance whilst alive of
doing better for himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>The idea that there was really a lonely wooden establishment
hidden in the deep seclusion of a certain forest,
where hunted men found refuge from the law, was most
fascinating to me, and this fascination was the main
incentive that took O’Hara and me there.</p>

<p class='c009'>When that old shellback stood on the Suva parade,
put his finger secretively up to the side of his corrugated
nasal organ, and gave us a significant wink of magnificent
import as to all that he could tell about that Charity
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>Organization, O’Hara’s heart seemed to fairly burst with
glorious anticipation. His curly hair seemed to bristle
forth the possibilities before us; his face flushed till his
bright blue eyes seemed to breathe forth the poetry of
romance. Nor was I myself far behind in my eagerness
to get to that mysterious residence of secretive men of
past crime. Besides, I was out in the world to take notes,
and was determined to take them.</p>

<p class='c009'>We lost no time. We packed up our goods and
trekked. By noon of the next day we had been paddled
in canoes across wide lagoons and up a mighty river
by friendly natives. Then we plunged into the bush-land.</p>

<p class='c009'>The very silence of that South Sea forest and the
gleam of the sea horizon—just visible through the woods
of mighty breadfruits—gave one’s imagination the atmosphere
of heathenland mystery. We could hear the
mountain drums beating the sunset down somewhere up
in the native villages. To the N.N.W. were the wild,
tribal, haunted mountains of <i>Vuni-cunu</i>, running in a
westerly direction, finally meeting the ranges of <i>Muanivatu</i>.
Around us stood huge tropical trees—banyans,
breadfruits, big bamboos, limes, and the ndrala laden
with scarlet blossoms. The airs of the deep glooms,
heavy with the wild perfumes of dying hibiscus and
many strange, exotic forest flowers, sent pungent odours
to our nostrils. Not so far away tumbled the cool, swirling
waters of the river, hurrying on their homeward
journey from the mountains that formed a grand, wildly
picturesque background to the district where the large,
shed-like building of the Charity Organization of the
South Seas was situated.</p>

<p class='c009'>Sheltered by feathery palms and one or two mighty
buttressed banyans, that dark, vine-overgrown building
looked like some peaceful hermitage, some primitive monastery
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>that sheltered aged missionaries. True enough,
missionaries dwelt therein; but what missionaries they
were!—men who relieved unhappy men who had shaved
their beards off and arrived in haste overburdened with
cash! Yes, they rested there in security till the hot scent
had blown over, and once again they could continue on
their way across the wine-dark seas, outbound for the
enchanted realms of No-Extradition Ports, where dwell
the Great Missing!</p>

<p class='c009'>Could one have put one’s ear to that Organization’s
low-roofed door, one would have distinctly heard a chorus
of muffled oaths and snatches of wild song droning from
the lips of the mysterious inmates of that Arabian Nights-like
establishment. Could one have opened that door on
the sly and peeped in, one would have seen a sight worth
seeing if only for its anthropological interest. All types
were there, from the genuine “hard up” honest sailorman
down to the reformed native from Timbuctoo.
There they sat: sun-tanned men from the seas, ex-convicts,
<i>libérés</i> from New Caledonia; handsome faces,
bleared and serious-looking; hideous, sallow faces with
pugnacious pug noses—Chinese, half-caste Malays, and
one or two runaway ships’ apprentices. Most of them
were leaning over the large bench-like table, shuffling
cards and drinking fiery rum, as ever and anon they
glanced beneath the rims of their wide-brimmed sombreros,
and stared with hunted-looking eyes toward the
shanty’s door. They were ever on the alert! O’Hara
and I had been in that place only two days when two
runaways arrived from Suva—one of whom hailed from
London Town, the other from Noumea. They usually
arrived without portmanteaux, under the cover of night,
tapped at the door, paid the bribe demanded, and so came
under the flag of brotherhood and the protection of that
Charity Organization’s kindness.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>O’Hara was tremendously excited about it all, and so
was I. We got to love exciting cases. One day, as
O’Hara and I were watching the antics of a covey of
native children romping like puppies in the forest ferns,
we heard the sound of voices.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s that?” said O’Hara.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sounds like the paddles of a canoe and voices on
the beach,” I replied.</p>

<p class='c009'>We listened again, and distinctly heard sounds as of a
woman weeping. Going up the little slope, we peeped
through the banyan trunks; sure enough, there were new
arrivals seeking the Organization’s shelter. They were
two in all, the third person, who was leading them across
the dense fern scrub, was Bill Bode, the second in command
of the shanty. One of the fugitives was a tall,
aristocratic-looking man; the other a young and pretty
girl. It was very evident that the latter felt depressed
as she looked in wonder at the sombre forest surrounding
us.</p>

<p class='c009'>The shadows of night were falling when we crept
softly down the tracks and once more entered that mysterious
shanty’s door.</p>

<p class='c009'>That building consisted of several large, low-roofed
rooms and two small compartments that were strictly
private. One was arranged with much taste, even decorated
with flower-pots and provided with the essentials
for a fragile guest; and when the fugitive arrived, bringing
with him the sad cause of his downfall, it was in
that small compartment that she slept!</p>

<p class='c009'>As O’Hara and I arrived in the rooms of that Sailors’
Boarding Establishment, for such it was to us, the new
arrival walked quietly into the primitive saloon bar, gave
a friendly nod to the members of the motley throng, and
sat down amongst the guests, who were mostly belated
sailors awaiting a ship. For, as I have intimated before,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>not all who dwelt beneath that roof were hiding from
the long arm of the law. If anyone had doubts as to
the respectability of that place, they would have been
quickly dispelled had he seen the look on the faces of
those rough men when someone tapped loudly at the
door. That same evening Ko-Ko, the half-caste native
maid, was dancing on the large bench at the far end of
the room. Everything seemed rosy and peaceful. As
the rough men cheered and repeatedly encored the girl’s
dances, and one played the banjo and step-danced an
incongruous <i>obligato</i> to the girl’s song, the hilarity was
suddenly turned off like a gas-jet! Crash! someone had
knocked violently at the shanty’s front door!</p>

<p class='c009'>Every “man-jack” breathed an oath, put his hand to
his sheath-knife, and glared his anticipation of the arrival
of the police from Suva. The new arrival trembled visibly,
and turned ashy-white as once more it came—crash!
crash! on the door.</p>

<p class='c009'>Just by the door was a huge tub which was a kind of
emergency barrel. The whole scene, there in the shadows,
seemed like some terribly realistic moving-picture show
enacting before our eyes. Bones had rushed from the
next room, lifted the vast lid from the barrel, while four
stalwart men lifted the new arrival bodily—crash! bang!
the stranger had gone!</p>

<p class='c009'>Only a muffled swear-word told the way of his going
as the lid went down.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bones, who was the head of that Organization, and
pocketed the bribes, gave his holiest smile, his half-humorous-looking
face betraying no sign of the intense
excitement of the moment when the new-comer had disappeared
from life’s wildest drama beneath the lid of that
huge barrel.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the door opened, a giant of a fellow stood framed
by the opening. It appeared that he was a half-caste
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>official from the Suva police force. When he had told
Bones that a canoe had been found on the beach, and
that they had received information that a fugitive from
the N.S.W. mail steamer had landed at Suva, Bones simulated
a terrible passion.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What the b—— h—— yer come ’ere for? What’s
that to do with me?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Keep yer wig on,” said the official, standing just
behind the first man, who by this time had given Bones
a significant wink. It required very little thought to
enable one to discern that Bones was well in with those
officials. And one’s suspicions would have soon been
confirmed had one seen the official in question sit down
on the emergency barrel, and grin from ear to ear as a
muffled sneeze came from beneath the lid!</p>

<p class='c009'>In a few moments the friendly man-hunters had passed
away, happy enough with their bribe—bribery being the
staple trade of that establishment.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next day a shot was heard in the forest. When the
Organization members rushed out beneath the palms, they
only discovered the quivering body of yesterday’s arrival—the
new-comer had blown the top of his head off! They
hid the body beneath the scrub. Next day they buried
him on the quiet, miles away, near the old-time sugar
plantations.</p>

<p class='c009'>Bones and three or four others were the chief mourners.
No coffin, simply a bit of old tarpaulin tied tightly at
the feet and again round the neck, the canvas so short
that the poor fugitive’s hair stuck out in a pathetic bunch.
It was like burying a man at sea as they dropped him
down into that hastily-dug hollow. O’Hara crossed himself.
Bones said something that sounded kind. As for
the girl, she wept bitterly, trembling like a leaf as she
knelt by the grave-side. It made me wonder if I dreamed
that sight—a grave in a South Sea forest, that silent,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>canvas-wrapt figure, and that innocent-looking girl with
a world of sorrow, utter misery on her face. She wasn’t
his daughter; there was something too passionately poetical
in the things she said as she knelt there, caring not
at all for the men who stared down at her with a misty
look in their eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>Two days after that, she had sufficiently recovered
so that she could venture to travel. The kindness of
Bones and the shady characters was something that revealed
in an indisputable manner that a woman’s presence
and sorrow have more religious influence on sinful
hearts than all the Psalms.</p>

<p class='c009'>No one knew the exact way of that girl’s going. But
the favoured theory was that Bones and the Organization
members had made a collection and so paid her fare
in the next steamer that was bound for London.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next day a clergyman arrived. “Ecclesiastical profession”
was writ in sombre lines across his lean physiognomy.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who’s coming here next?” breathed O’Hara, as we
looked up from the pages of our novels, making sure that
he too was fleeing from the righteous arm of justice.
But we were mistaken. He was simply a kind-hearted
religious crank who spent his days in wandering from
isle to isle seeking to reform fallen men. His woe-begone,
melancholy aspect cast a deep gloom over the
establishment as he moaned out sad quotations from his
Bible, a gloom that pervaded the forest and darkened
the sea horizon. Bones shook him heartily by the hand
when he first arrived and said pious things. Bones had
a face like cast-iron, but was soft-hearted and the finest
hypocrite extant. Some of the honest sailormen, yielding
to that sad ecclesiastic’s soft persuasion, listened to
long passages from the Psalms and Solomon’s Song.
Then he took O’Hara and me down to the tribal villages
<span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>and introduced us to some of the old-time chiefs. Shaggy
old women prostrated themselves at his feet as he prayed
for their souls.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was very evident that he had been that way before.
Everyone seemed to know him. I got to like him immensely
during the two days that he stopped with Bones.
His madness was interesting and original, and made an
agreeable change after consorting with mortals who were
quite sane. Then he, too, passed away on his melancholy
wanderings.</p>

<p class='c009'>After he went, there arrived a troupe of troubadours,
who came from Melbourne as deck-passengers on a
schooner. Among their number were three American
girls who turned that shanty into a kind of <i>opéra bouffe</i>,
as they sang and step-danced in a wonderful way. The
scene inside when the girls danced and the fat man
played his guitar, looked like some living-picture representation
of Madame Tussaud’s, as though all the lifeless
criminals had been mysteriously awakened and were
applauding the visitors, waving big hats in wild ecstasy
at being serenaded so sweetly while in their degraded
state. For, as they listened to the troubadours, about
twenty of us stood by, looking on the shadowy scene
lit up by the tallow candles that swung to and fro on
wires suspended from the roof of the wide bar-room.</p>

<p class='c009'>I believe the wandering troupe made a splendid collection
that night. I know the fat man, with a big
stomach, got very drunk, sang several songs, and then
fell down. And the girls giggled all night long as they
slept in the private compartment, wherein the unhappy
fugitive girl had rested the night before.</p>

<p class='c009'>Next day the troupe bade us all farewell, for they
were bound for ’Frisco, and the boat was leaving at
noon.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_284'>284</span>I think O’Hara and I had been at the establishment
for two weeks then. It wasn’t a long time, but I had
seen more strange sides of life in that short time than
one could well see under normal circumstances in twenty
years. But it must be admitted that my immediate experiences
seemed very vapid compared with the exciting
adventures of the peculiar men who arrived at the Charity
Hermitage and seemed never weary of telling their reminiscences
and hairbreadth escapes to the new-comers.
Even O’Hara opened his mouth in astonishment at all
he heard from the lips of those who yearned to tell yarns,
as over and over again some strange old derelict would
pull his whiskers while dropping into deep meditation
as to “what happened next.” That Hermitage of the
South Seas was a kind of Old Inn on life’s highway
wherein sad men entered from the unknown, sat and
drank, sang a song, and then departed out into the unknown,
sometimes in a great hurry. Three extraordinary-looking
beings arrived at the Hermitage one night.
One resembled Don Quixote <i>in extremis</i>, another had a
huge crooked nose that was swathed by a vast reddish
beard, and the third had a huge, domed bald head that
looked like a mighty billiard ball with flapping ears.
They were attired in loose, dilapidated pantaloons, heavy
belts, coloured shirts, and firearms, and might have been
South Sea freebooters, blackbirders, or anything that is
wild and lawless, if appearances are to be relied upon.
They hadn’t been in the Organization Hermitage twelve
hours before the half-caste surveillants arrived at the
door. The three new-comers at once made a bolt out
under the palms that led down to the seashore, a quarter
of a mile off. And, if anyone had happened to pass
along the sands that afternoon, they would assuredly have
seen three weird-looking objects with twinkling eyes
sticking up out of the calm blue waters by the shore’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_285'>285</span>coral reefs. To an imaginative observer those objects
would certainly have resembled the figureheads of three
sunken Chinese junks, wooden faces protruding, just visible
at low-tide, the eyes glassy, staring at the sky, lips
tightly compressed, the nostrils level with the ocean’s
surface. But then again, the vast polished bald head
of one was unaccountable, and the bristly hair of another
toned down the weird unreality of the scene. For who
ever saw a hideous Chinese junk’s figure-head with thick
hair on its crown, and tobacco smoke issuing from its
mouth? In short, those three objects were the heads of
the three new-comers, their bodies hidden beneath the
sea’s surface, their heads and nostrils exposed just sufficient
so that they might inhale the breeze, as they hid
from the surveillants! Next day the natives missed a
twelve-seater outrigger canoe. And had high chief
Makaroa looked seaward, instead of kneeling and weeping
before his old idol, he would have seen a small object
fading away on the ocean horizon far to the S.W. It
was none other than Makaroa’s missing canoe, with the
three fugitives, out on the wide world of waters, bound
for Nowhere! But all this is only a detail.</p>

<p class='c009'>Perhaps it will not be out of place to tell one of the
yarns that we heard at the Hermitage,—not a swash-buckling
story, but a tale that had the indisputable ring
of truth in it. The teller of the story was a weird-looking
fellow of about fifty years of age. He had lived in the
Solomons and Fiji for years. I think he was a trader.
Anyway, he had travelled the South Seas in the old
heathen times, had lived in Fiji when cannibalism was
in vogue, and King Thakombau reigned supreme over
his dominions from the old capital of Bau. In these
pages I will call him G——. I cannot reproduce his
exquisite manner in telling a story. I had never heard
anything like it before. He had lived in the isles to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_286'>286</span>east when Bully Hayes roamed the seas, when King
Tembinok of Apamama was in his cannibal youthful
prime, and Queen Vaekehu of Tai-o-hae welcomed many
a dusky potentate into her impassioned arms.</p>

  <h2 id='ch16' class='c007'>CHAPTER XVI. YORAKA’S DAUGHTER</h2>
</div>
<p class='c017'>The Wild White Girl—The Wagner of Storms—A
Pagan Citadel—Pagan Democracy—Ye Old Britisher—A
Battle in the Dark.</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c008'>FIRST I must state that G—— was a casual member
of the Charity Organization, an Englishman, and,
from the general run of his conversation and manner,
gave one the impression that he had seen better days.
But there was nothing wonderful about that, for it is a
fact that many of the apparent rogues of those days
betrayed something of past polish, and possessed a personality
infinitely more interesting than that of men who
had never stepped over the border-line.</p>

<p class='c009'>G—— was a big lump of a fellow, just over six feet
in height, and had fine, expressive eyes full of humour
and sometimes revealing a lingering sadness that made
one’s heart go out to him. Personally, I liked him immensely.
He could play the flute as well as he could
tell a yarn, and that’s saying something!</p>

<p class='c009'>But I would say, right here, that the story that he
told me, and which I will tell here, is told not so much
for the presumable interest that it might give as a mere
yarn, as for my absolute confidence in the veracity of
the man who told me it, his manner whilst telling it
leaving such a possibility as doubt or exaggeration quite
out of the question. Nor was there any justifiable reason
why one should be sceptical, since G—— had lived, as
I have said, in Fiji when cannibalism was in vogue, and
white men arrived at the islands and did very much as
they liked,—some resorting to savagery, some giving
<span class='pageno' id='Page_288'>288</span>their hand in marriage to dusky queens, ascending thrones
and holding full sway over swarthy populations of
heathenland.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a glorious tropical eventide when G——,
O’Hara, and I sat under the palms as the fireflies commenced
to dance in the bamboos by the shore lagoons.
G—— took his pipe from his lips, stroked his bearded
chin in his characteristic way, and commenced:</p>

<p class='c009'>“You must know, boys, that things were very different
in these parts in the old semi-heathen times. I had
arrived for the second time in Levuka then, had left a
trading schooner, and was spending my time in looking
round. I was a bit of a romantic loony in those days,
and when my pal, Mick Deny, who had been shipmate
with me for two years, heard that a Britisher, a fugitive
from justice, was living like a wild man up in the Kai
Tholos mountains with his daughter, we got interested,
I can tell you. We got the whole facts of the case out
of one of the Kai Tholos natives who had come into
Levuka to get fish. Deny was a bit gone on girls, and
when he heard that the Britisher had brought that young
daughter of his out to these infernal regions and had
brought her up as a heathen amongst those tribal natives,
he was as eager as I to visit the stronghold in the mountains
and see how matters stood. It appeared that this
fugitive Britisher had assumed command over the tribe
with whom he dwelt, styled himself as Roko (high chief),
taken unto himself several native wives, and resorted to
the unbridled lust and degradation of savagery.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘How old is the girl?’ queried Deny, as the native
trader told us these facts.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘She nicer Marama, grow up beautifuls, nicer crown
hair, nicer eyes, colour of <i>moani ali</i> (the ocean).’</p>

<p class='c009'>“As that Fijian gabbled away, waxing enthusiastic
over the beauty of the exiled white girl up there, imprisoned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_289'>289</span>from the sight of her own race, Deny and I
fairly gasped over the idea of it all. We got no sleep
that night. The idea of that girl being cruelly treated
by her criminal parent seemed to set our brains afire
with romantic ideas. By the morning we had made our
minds up, and had decided to make an expedition up
into the Tholos mountains. The first thing to do was
to get some goods, so I went down to the schooners that
lay in the harbour, cadged some sugar, tea, tobacco plug,
and those essentials which I guessed would meet our requirements.
Deny’s eyes flashed with delight at the idea
of it all. The risk of the job we were undertaking did
not deter us, it only added spice to the business. And
the natives, I can tell you, were not as chummy in those
days as they are now. Old Thakombau had only just
been converted to Christianity, had swallowed four casks
of sacramental rum, and had shaken hands with all the
missionaries. But he was a sly old fellow, and didn’t
know anything about the tribal fights and the missing
bodies of the dead after the <i>Bokolai</i> feast (cannibal
feast). Oh no! Not he. He was quite converted!
When we had packed up our few traps, not forgetting
my flute, and were quite ready to start off, little Sanga,
the native girl who did our cooking in the beach shanty
(only one store in Levuka in these days), started crying,</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘You no-e takeer little Sanga longer you?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Let the kid come,’ said Deny; ‘besides, she’ll be
useful, knows the lingo, and that kind of thing,’ he added.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘All right, Sanga; don’t grizzle,’ said I.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then Deny and I went into the village to get permission
from Sanga’s parents.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She couldn’t go off on an excursion like that without
getting permission from her parents. Sanga’s mother,
a fine-looking half-caste, gave us the kid in complete
confidence.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_290'>290</span>“‘You noble Papalagis; me trust her with you.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Yes, we’re holy beggars,’ thought I, as we walked
away across the <i>rara</i>, Sanga somersaulting with delight
like a puppy at our heels, as we left the village and
started on our trip to find out all about the Britisher and
his daughter. We <i>did</i> take care of that kiddie too, although
we had some rough times ere bringing her safely
back to her village.</p>

<p class='c009'>“By midday next day we had tramped many miles
inland, and had already crossed the lower ranges of the
mountains to the N.N.W.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Sanga was a blessing to us, and sang weird heathen
songs as she tramped by our side. I had dressed her up
in a little blue kimono which I had cut out of a large
silk handkerchief, cutting holes in it for the armpits.
When she looked at herself in the lagoon hard by, she
chuckled with delight. The first night was all that could
be desired as we slept beneath the palms, side by side,
and Deny sang a highland song till I fell asleep.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The next night a typhoon blew. It was something
that I had never heard before in the way of nature’s
extempore musical expression. As you know, I am not
much of a musician. I can play the flute and knock
out the common chords for a song and dance on the
piano; but to describe the harmonies that storm made
in the mountains is quite beyond me. We were all
tired out, just going off to sleep. In fact, I heard Deny
snoring. Sanga lay at my feet, her head on my calf,
as she hummed in the dark. Then it came—no warning,
mind you. Bang! It seemed as if there had been some
tremendous upheaval in interstellar space, that worlds
and planets were exploding like vast bombs somewhere
beyond the moon, the south-western horizon being repeatedly
blown out as the débris struck the mountains
around us. The enormous breadfruits and banyans, all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_291'>291</span>bending and howling like the sails, rigging, and masts
of ships in a hurricane, moaned a wild symphony in the
pitch darkness, for the clouds had slid over, puff! and
put the moon out without any warning. Once a star
gleamed as the wrack raced across the sky. Sanga
huddled close up to Deny as I put my hand out to see
where they were. Then the moon burst through the cloud
and the shadows went racing across the gullies till it
seemed that the mountains themselves were moving along,
sailing before a head wind! Then the deluge began.
We were sheltered in a native hut, but the rain came in
by the bucketful. Oceans seemed to crash down from
the sky. Mighty trees were uplifted, and before they
fell to the earth were carried across the gullies like twigs
before the tremendous violence of the wind. Then there
started the most wonderful thing in the way of sound
that I have ever heard, or shall ever hear again. It
seemed that a thousand demons had come out to carouse
and play ghostly instruments in some phantom military
band. I never heard anything to resemble it. Drums
began to beat, a thousand strong, bassoons, horns, double
basses, clarionets, ’cellos, saxaphones, bugles, cornets—all
wailing and bellowing forth in the wildest orchestral
combination that human ears ever heard. ‘God! What
is it pal?’ yelled Deny in my ear, and his voice sounded
like the wail of a child. My own heart thumped.
‘Strange that I should live to see the end of the world,’
thought I, as that terrible nightmare of sound suddenly
subsided, while the typhoon stopped a moment to take
breath! We didn’t know it then, but that typhoon was a
kind of mighty Wagner of the elements that came by
night with universal breath to blow the terrific diapasons,
vast bassoons and thunderous wails, whistles, and timpani
effects in the mightiest orchestral instrument that creation
has made, so far as I know. It was like this: those
<span class='pageno' id='Page_292'>292</span>mountains were volcanic, and so were fairly <i>honeycombed</i>
with precipitous tunnels and big cavernous hollows, each
hollow possessing its own peculiar, specific quality of
sound, so that when the typhoon arrived, and its ten
thousand orchestral members, so to speak, placed their
phantom lips and blew terrifically into each crevice, the
noise resembled something like ten thousand Easter
Monday steam-organs and beating-drums going hard and
strong on some holiday down in shadowland!</p>

<p class='c009'>“I don’t exaggerate when I say that some of the notes
rang out in clear, silvery, bugle tones, some full and
mellow, tremulous with throbbing expression; then the
muffled sound of a mighty drum would boom out in that
infinite harmony of the dark and wind! When you
consider that a typhoon’s terrific and tremendously varied
breathing powers blew through a thousand thousand deep-voiced
bugles and trumpets with curling tubes that went
running right down into the volcanic bowels of the Fijian
Isles, there wasn’t much wonder in the fact that wonderfully
marvellous subtle musical effects and perfect intonation
should crop up somewhere. Of course, Deny
and I hadn’t the slightest idea then as to how that pandemonium
of sound came about.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘The end of the world arrived and they sent
some kind of a brass band to lead the battalions of the
dead heathens into shadowland; that’s what it is,’ yelled
Deny, cheering up when I touched him, to assure myself
that we were still in the flesh.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think Sanga cheered us up more than anything.
She even laughed, just as we thought we were about to
die too!</p>

<p class='c009'>“She was a plucky youngster, and good-looking to
boot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When dawn came the sun burst through the sky as
though it was in a hurry. It seemed to boil the soaking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_293'>293</span>mountain forests. We could see the chameleon-like
colours sparkling, as the steam from the heated tropical
vegetation rolled away over the rugged hills. We were
drenched through. By nightfall I was seized with pains
in the back. It was a kind of malaria. My limbs began
to quiver. By midnight I was delirious.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Don’t die, pal,’ said Deny, as I begged him, for old-time’s
sake, to strangle the mighty heathen god who kept
peering through the clouds, putting his stinking mop-head
against my nose as he struck me tremendous blows on
the head with a war-club! But I could not die. When
I had slept for an hour and got a bit sane, things seemed
as bad. For the thousands of insects that had sought
refuge from the storm in our hut attacked me. Scorpions,
fat-bodied lizards, and huge red ants, as big as
walnuts, and red land-crabs formed up in regiments and
attacked us. I felt strange things creeping up the inside
of my pants as they flapped their rudimentary wings.
Then Deny took me outside and gave me a drink of rum.
In a few minutes the fever had abated. By midday I
was as fit as a fiddle.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Deny was a splendid cook. He gathered some <i>feis</i>
(bananas) and yams from the garden of the deserted
heathen hut, and made a glorious meal.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then we started off, Sanga singing cheerily behind
us as we trekked it up into the higher ranges.</p>

<p class='c009'>“By this time we were near Nisao, and had already
sighted one of the native villages to the S.W. Though
we had heard that the natives of that part were friendly,
still we were not taking any risks, so we sent Sanga across
the gullies as an advance-guard. She whipped off like
an arrow, without the slightest fear. When she came
back she was accompanied by four stalwart chiefs and
two women. To our relief they were waving their hands
friendly-wise, welcoming us to their village.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_294'>294</span>“As we crossed the gully bridge—a huge breadfruit
trunk—the sight of the small conical homesteads beneath
the feathery palms, the beautiful moss-ferns, and scarlet-flowered
ndralas, gave one the impression that we were
entering some perfect, pagan city of shadowland. Romping
children stopped their games, rushed out of the shadows
and hut doorways to gaze on Deny and me in astonishment.
The shaggy-haired women by the huts were
smoking clay pipes, squatting on mats, and staring stolidly
at the pretty native girls, who fawned about us,
stroked our hands, and said in their own lingo, ‘O
beautiful Papalagis, with blue eyes!’</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was all right, I can tell you. Suddenly a giant of
a fellow stood up from among a huddled group of savages
and come towards us. By the distinguished tattooesque
coat-of-arms on his massive chest and shoulders,
I knew that he must be the tribal chief. Besides, as
he came towards us, he was followed by an obsequious
retinue of eight half-decayed-looking old women, who
were crawling on their wrinkled stomachs as they placed
their travelling hands in their august master’s footprints.
They were his old, cast-off wives. The new batch of
young wives were squatting by the big palavana, showing
their pearly teeth and making eyes at Deny and me. One
cheeky little wench, who was clad in a tappa-gown of
two inches in width and half a yard in length, took a
flower from her hair and threw it towards us.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can remember it all as though it were yesterday. I
can even hear the strange bird that was singing up in the
citron trees, which grew just over the little plot where
they buried their dead. We felt a bit swaggery when
the military band came out of the chief palavana, formed
up with their instruments (vuvis, bone flutes, human
bones, gourds with strings across, lais, wooden drums,
and bamboo flutes), and commenced to play an anthem
<span class='pageno' id='Page_295'>295</span>of welcome as we entered the stockade gateway that led
into that portion of the village where the head chief received
ambassadors in council. I think the sight of all
was Sanga, as she marched just ahead of us, a flower
dangling in her hair, and her little chest swelled majestically,
as she looked sideways on the tribal children, who
were staring at her with awestruck eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“If I had had any poetic idea in my head about that
village being some dwelling-place of fairy-land, I’m sure
it was soon dispelled when we passed by the village dustbin.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Phew!’ said Deny, as Sanga and I sniffed and held
our noses. Even in those high altitudes of the Fijian
mountain villages there was considerable room for sanitary
improvement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Such was our reception in Nisao just twenty years
ago.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That same night we got pally with the high chief,
Roko (meaning ‘high-born’). He gave us all the direct
information that we required; told us that, true enough,
a white man did dwell up in the cool mountain villages
of the cannibal Kai Tholos. Then he told us how the
<i>White Roko</i> had lorded it over the village folk of Tumba
for quite ten years, after having made himself their chief.
It seemed as though we dreamed it all as we stood there,
Deny and I, and heard the astounding facts as we warily
got the friendly chief on the tack that we were most
interested in. He nodded his head and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Yes, Papalagi, beautiful white <i>Marama</i> (white girl)
live up there too; nicer chiefess; smoother shoulders,
whiter skin.’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Saying this, old Roko made various descriptive signs
in an attempt to convey to our minds the wondrous beauty
of the White Roko’s daughter. It was then that we learnt
that the Englishman was known to his tribe by the name
<span class='pageno' id='Page_296'>296</span>of Yoraka. Whether his name was Yorick, and this
name that he was known by was a bastardized equivalent
of it, I don’t know; possibly it was so.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I recall that that old chief was immensely amused
when he discovered that Deny and I were after the white
girl.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘How does she dress? What does she do with herself?
Is she wild? Is she married?’ and such-like questions
did we put to Roko.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Roko did not know much about the girl’s habits, for
she was seldom allowed out of the Tholos stronghold,
and Old chief Roko dared not go up there to his neighbour’s
stronghold because they were enemies. We were
delighted to hear that he was not on friendly terms with
this extraordinary Yoraka, for it enabled us to extract
a promise from him to help us out of it should we get
into difficulties. We arranged that, should our countryman
‘turn up rough’ and set his tribal heathen on us,
we should send Sanga back to his village for help.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Things are going all right,’ chuckled Deny, when the
old chief took a vow to help us.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Vinaka, O le tani—geroot!’ yelled the tribal warriors.
Then they lined up; and I can tell you, Deny and
I felt considerably relieved as we inspected Roko’s bodyguard—the
war chiefs who would come to our help if
we needed them. We felt like two seasoned generals as
we passed along the lines, inspecting those weird-looking,
tattooed warriors. They swelled their massive chests,
their big war-club handles standing on end up to their
shoulders. They had tremendous mouths, the teeth darkened
with the juice of the betel-nut; and such mops of
hair, I’d never seen the like before.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Thank God they’re on <i>our</i> side!’ was my mental
comment, as the great Roko shouted ‘Karoot!’ and up
went fifty war-clubs, ere down they came, crash! in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_297'>297</span>thunderous drill that would show us how easily they
could smash the thickest of skulls with one well-aimed
blow!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Twelve hours after that experience we had done the
eight miles that divided Roko’s village from the Tholos
stronghold. We were actually in sight of that tiny
mountain citadel wherein had dwelt for nearly ten years
that fugitive Britisher, Yoraka.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There was something terribly weird in the thought
that up there was one of our own race who had degenerated
into complete savagery and held full sway over the
wild Kai Tholos natives. It were impossible for me to
attempt to find a name for the atmosphere that my imagination
conjured up as Deny and I stood there, our white
helmet hats pushed back on our heads, our hands arched
to our eyes as we stared towards the sunset that gleamed
on the far-off tribal huts of that solitary stronghold.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘What would they think of us? How would they
greet us? Would the white girl scream and faint away
at the delight of it all when she realized that Deny and
I had come to rescue her? Had she seen white men—other
than that damnable parent of hers? Or had
she been a close prisoner from childhood, kept in utter
darkness of the great civilized world beyond the seas?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“A thrill of romance warmed my soul, pulsing through
my veins like wine, as the novelty, the wonder of it all
seemed to shine in the magical ultramarine of the far-off
sea horizon and the mountain sunset. Within an hour
of our romantic contemplation of the village, we had
actually entered the stockade gates. I clutched my
revolver, and Deny did likewise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Just as the children had done in the last village, out
ran the kiddies from the huts, rushed up to us and
shouted, ‘Vinaka! Vinaka!’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘They’ve seen plenty of white people before, that’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_298'>298</span>certain,’ said I to Deny, as the old, squat-looking chiefs
and shaggy-haired chiefesses stared stolidly at us as we
walked by. Possibly it was our tremendous cheek and
helpless appearance that disarmed the suspicions of those
wild-looking men and women as they shouted forth their
acclamations of welcome.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We gave them bits of tobacco plug. Thinking it was
wisest to make no delay in letting them know that we
were there on a friendly visit, we straightway asked
them to show us into the presence of the great White
Roko, Yoraka. Approaching a monstrous-looking chief
who was heavily decorated with insigniatorial tattoo, we
expressed our wish. In a moment a bodyguard had
been formed and was solemnly walking ahead of us,
leading us through the village. Sanga walked between
Deny and me. I noticed that she too looked a bit serious
as she clutched hold of the knee of my trousers. Passing
through a large archway, that seemed to be of natural
rock formation, we entered another district of the village.
As we turned the bend by the orange and citron trees,
our hearts thumped. We were standing before a large,
conical-shaped building that had evidently been built on
European lines. We guessed that we were at last standing
before the residence of the ex-Britisher.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It seemed incredible as we stood there and thought
of the man who had exiled himself from his race and
had resorted to the unbridled lust and squalor of all that
we saw around us—girls and women in all stages of
undress and motherhood. But it was not so strange when
one thinks of the criminals and unbridled lust and squalor
of the dens of great cities—cities superintended by vigilant
police officials with the power of a nation to help
them put down crime. And who will deny that, notwithstanding
Scotland Yard, London, and White House,
New York, crime does exist, that men <i>do</i> revert back
<span class='pageno' id='Page_299'>299</span>to their primitive instincts, resort to bestiality, murder,
and all that’s utterly opposed to the instincts of decently
trained, clean-minded men. However, the fact remains
that there <i>was</i> a white man who dwelt in complete savagery
in the mountains to the N.N.W., however incredible
it may seem. And nothing could be more certain
than the sound of a drunken voice singing an English
song, the melody of ‘There is a tavern in the town, in
the town!’ coming from the inside of that primitive but
palatial-looking dwelling before us!</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Keep close to me, Sanga,’ said I, as the chiefs turned
and beckoned us. Then Deny’s tall form stooped as he
bent forward and entered the doorway, while Sanga and
I closely followed him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Though I had conjured up all kinds of picturesque
types in my mind as to what kind of a man I should see
when I entered there, I’ll swear that I was quite unprepared
for the villainous type that I did see. Squatting
on a mat, native fashion, was a burly-looking man of
about fifty years of age. His face was a dull, pasty
brown; indeed, the man before us was more like a half-caste
than any type I could think of at the moment. Even
his hair was done up in a large mop, native style. But
the reddish colour of the beard, and the deep-set, keen
grey eyes were unmistakable—there squatted a degenerate
Britisher, robed in all the glory of primitive royalty.
Hanging from the wide, low roof were some forty coconut-oil
lamps which added to the mystery of the scene
before us. In a semicircle, almost up to his feet, squatted
several native women, some of them young girls, presumably
his wives. To our astonishment he nodded his
head, as though courteously to acquaint us with the fact
that he was pleased to see us. This welcome of his
seemed incongruous enough, since he wore only a tasselled
sulu about his loins, a garb that barely reached
<span class='pageno' id='Page_300'>300</span>to his muscular, hairy knees. As he stood up he resembled
nothing so much as some primitive blacksmith
who wore a leather apron only—had forgotten to put
his trousers on.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The walls were decorated with fibre matting, skulls,
old men’s beards, and other gruesome articles that make
up the furniture of barbarian homesteads. On the floor
in front of him were large calabashes, some full of fruits,
others containing fermenting toddy. These facts I took
in at a glance as Deny stood speechless on one side of me
and Sanga clutched my hand on the other side.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Suddenly he looked up, and said: ‘Vinaka, sirs!
glader to see you, o le su, ter-day, savve?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“So long had it been since he had spoken to his countrymen
that he had actually got into the habit of speaking
pigeon English! For a little while he regarded us with
suspicion, then, as he took another drink of toddy from
the calabash that the native girls held to his lips, he
became garrulous. As he spoke on I noticed that his
speech improved; one could almost hear the awakening
in his brain of words that had lain dormant for years.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Though I courteously refused to drink of the toddy
that he ordered to be handed to me, Deny, to my regret,
swallowed more than was good for him. This convivial
understanding of like appetites seemed to awaken his
interest in us, for ere long Deny stood before him and
sang some old Scottish songs—‘Robin Adair,’ and ‘Will
ye no’ come back again?’ I think. He gave orders to
his concubines to fetch us sweet taro, pineapples, and
many mixed dishes that were made from indigenous
fruits. Then he shifted himself, squatted right opposite
me, and commenced to ask me questions about England.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Whas London loiker? He! he! he! Does the ole
Queen still sit on her throne at Windsor? He! he!’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Saying that, he gave a lurch forward, and I saw that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_301'>301</span>the pose he had assumed when we entered his dwelling-place
had been dispelled by drivelling intoxication. Still
he raved on, nudged me in the ribs, and shouted toasts
to other days! Thrusting his pallid face forward, he
lifted the coco-nut goblet, and yelled again and again,
‘’Ows ye b—— ole Queen!’ then he gave me another
violent nudge, and roared with laughter.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Nasty-looking ole swine!’ said Deny, as Sanga
pinched my arm and said in a quiet voice:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Come away! Come away, Papalagi!’</p>

<p class='c009'>“I saw that the kiddie didn’t like the look of that
man of my race, who leered towards her, and touched her
smooth arms. Then Deny and he became reminiscent
as they discovered they were both familiar with Fleet
Street. I must say I felt a bit ashamed of my comrade,
as he too lurched forward and nudged that vile Britisher
in the ribs. It was plain as plain could be that that
cursed toddy stuff had made Deny forget himself.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Deny, Deny!’ I said reprovingly.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Alas, my pal responded only by looking up at me in
an insane way and gurgling out, ’Awl ’ight, pal!’</p>

<p class='c009'>“As for Yoraka, he opened his slit mouth, drivelled
like an imbecile, poked his pallid tongue out over his
sharp-edged, blackened teeth, and yelled:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Do the b—— natives on ye old Thames still wear
clothes? He! he! How’s ther Derby racecourse? By
the gods of my fathers, I’d giver something for a soda
and whisky ter-night!’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Saying this much, as near as I can recall all that he
said, he lurched, put his head forward, and pinched little
Sanga’s small fat leg! The kiddie almost screamed in
her terror.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘It’s all right, Sanga. Don’t mind him. He’s only
a drunken Britisher,’ said I swiftly, as the degenerate
stooped over his toddy calabash and offered Deny another
<span class='pageno' id='Page_302'>302</span>gobletful. And all the while this was going on his women
and girl wives and servants, squatting on a mat in a
semicircle round him, were regarding Deny and me with
curious stare.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then, once again, in hoarse acclamations, he yelled
of England.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Do they still read their Bibles—the pot-bellied,
wassailed-eyed English? Ye souls of missionaries, I’ve
eaten better men than you blooder Englishman!’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Listening to those wild remarks from a drunken man,
and a fugitive British criminal into the bargain, I put
his wild sayings down as figures of speech that represented
some bitterness in his heart over memories of
other days. By now he was drivelling copiously at the
mouth, the mop of hair had fallen and hung in ringlets
on his brow. He resembled some giant chimpanzee as
he squatted before us, his narrow eyes glittering, his
reddish beard bunched to his neck, as he looked at Deny
and me and volleyed forth terrible oaths.</p>

<p class='c009'>“’Ow’s ole Fleet Street? Did yer chance ter know the
barmaid at ole M——’s, Alice M’Gill eh? She was a
fine wench; hell, what a figure, a body, he! he! she
had!’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then he yelped forth another volley of disgusting
ribaldry that I wouldn’t repeat if you wanted me to.</p>

<p class='c009'>“While all this was going on, my eyes were squinting
round, wondering where on earth the girl was whom we
had heard so much about.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Deny had started to sing with Yoraka, who had
begun to sing in a drivelling voice:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘There is a tavern in the town, in the town,</div>
      <div class='line'>Where my true love sits him down, sits him down.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>“Then Yoraka continued:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>‘I’ll ’ang me ’arp oner weepin’ willer tree</div>
      <div class='line'>And may ther worle go well with thee.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'><span class='pageno' id='Page_303'>303</span>“Not liking to be left out of the ensemble, as the
assembled wives, girls, and servants beat their hands in
a kind of chant,—I saw that the Britisher had taught
them all that song, for they chanted it in a rather effective
manner,—I took my flute from my breast pocket and
commenced to play. It must have been an incongruous
sight to see and to hear as that disgusting relic of our
race squatted there, a grin on his blubbery jowls, as
Deny, with lifted hand, sang and made eyes at the
passable-looking girls of the royal retinue, and I stood,
<i>maestro</i> fashion, my helmet hat bashed against the low
roof, performing on the flute. It was whilst this quartette
was in progress that the improbable occurred. Suddenly
the row of tattooed Fijians, who were huddled
by the door of some inner compartment, all moved as
though to make way for someone. The tappa curtains
were drawn aside. I stopped my flute-playing; Deny
opened his mouth and gasped aloud. There she stood,
her pale blue eyes open with astonishment as she stared
wistfully, like a shadowy-figure in a South Sea picture,
on Deny and then on me. It was Yoraka’s, that loathsome
British criminal’s, daughter!</p>

<p class='c009'>“To my eyes, which had never before seen a pure-blooded
white girl in native costume, expressing all the
innocent abandonment of natural life in the pose of her
figure and movement of her shapely limbs, she seemed
the most impressively beautiful example of charming
womanhood that my eyes had ever beheld. She was
sun-tanned from head to feet, as though she had been
varnished by some artist with a wondrous mixture that
resembled a Cremona violin’s hue mixed up with sunlight.
The picturesque raiment of threaded fern grass that
swathed her thighs, like a loin-cloth, increased the beauty
of the picture of that wild white girl who stood there
before us. She looked like the pictures I have seen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_304'>304</span>of Queen Boadicea. Her hair was a bright golden-bronze
hue, like that deep shade seen in the sunset’s
aftermath, her rough, loosened tresses falling down to
the exquisitely curved shoulders, while one or two stray
locks fell in front, rippling down over her bosom to the
tasselled raiment that fell in modest modulation to her
knees. I had a suspicion that she had been told we
were there in that palavana, that she had peeped through
the tappa-curtains and seen us, and had then gone and
arranged her secret toilet to please our eyes. I discovered
afterwards that the hue of her hair and the length of
her tresses were the pride of the whole tribe, the chiefs
giving cattle to Yoraka that they might breathe through
her tresses, and so treating her as a goddess!</p>

<p class='c009'>“I think Deny’s heart went out to her at once. However,
I know that when the strains of the flute mingled
with the notes of the Scottish songs he sang that night,
it was very hard to know which sounded the most beseeching!</p>

<p class='c009'>“That which struck me forcibly as I scanned the girl’s
clear eyes and fine brow was, that she should really be
the daughter of the chimpanzee-like debauchee squatting
there before us. But, recalling to mind the trite old
saying, ‘’Tis a wise child that knows its own father,’ I
gave the girl the benefit of the doubt; nor did this
opinion of mine cast a slur on the mother, for by the
character of the man before us, none could blame her
for bestowing her secret affections on another than her
‘rightful lord.’ I confess that the girl had her failings.
But they seemed only some natural expression of the
innate instincts that are prominent in all the actions of
her more fortunate, civilized white sisters. For, as I
watched, it was quite evident that, notwithstanding
Deny’s boisterous manner as he ogled her, twirling his
moustache and assuming a massive gallantry that I had
<span class='pageno' id='Page_305'>305</span>not thought him capable of, she favoured his advances;
indeed, she actually returned with interest his admiring
looks as her eyes roamed up and down his giant figure,
that swayed, drunken-wise, before her.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘He! he! nicer girl—eh?’ leered Yoraka, as he observed
Deny’s infatuated glances.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then that heathen scoundrel lurched forward and
pinched Sanga’s leg again, putting on such an unholy
look as he gazed on her, that I felt like giving him a
punch under the ear. I’ve seen Chinamen, Niggers,
Kaffirs, Turks, all grades of followers of Mohammed,
Borneo cannibals, and what not, gaze on young native
girls, but the look in that degenerate Britisher’s eyes
beat them all for downright wickedness. He looked like
some personification of all the guile, hypocrisy, power,
indescribable lust, and bestiality of white man, that have
blighted native life in these isles, crammed into one skull,
gleaming forth from one pair of terrible eyes, drivelling
and chuckling from one mouth, expressed on one iron
brow, voiced by one filthy, fang-like tongue.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Deny’s dead now. I won’t say a word of the further
doings of that night. He’d been down with fever too;
the weather was terribly muggy into the bargain, and
that does put a thirst into a man. And, moreover, notwithstanding
the hideousness of all Yoraka’s actions, and
the fright that we both confessed we felt afterwards,
through being in his power, there was something fascinating
in the novelty of it all. I think it took twelve high
chiefs to carry Deny across the <i>rara</i> (space) and lay
him down in the hut that had been allotted to him, Sanga,
and my humble self.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I rubbed my eyes in the morning, wondering if I
had dreamed it all. It was no dream though; there was
no mistaking the reality of the wild bird’s song that sang
in the mountain banyans just outside our hut door. Besides,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_306'>306</span>there sat little Sanga, rubbing her sleepy eyes, and
Deny was as real as real could be, as he sat there with
his head in a large calabash of cold water, cooling his
fevered skull!</p>

<p class='c009'>“We had no sooner eaten the food that the natives
brought to us than we were outside in the clear morning
air. Our great desire was to see that white girl again.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘We must get her away from this hell of a hole,’
said Deny, turning his eyes away from me as though
he felt a bit ashamed of himself. Then he said: ‘You
got a bit rocky last night, didn’t you, pal?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘A bit rocky!’ said I, feeling disgusted at such an
insinuation from my comrade, who had lowered my
prestige in that village by his drunken behaviour the
night before. But I said nothing. I saw how the wind
blew. And it says something for Deny that he was
enough ashamed of himself to try and make out that I
was as bad as he.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I won’t go into all the details as to how we finally
got to know where the girl was to be found. It will
be sufficient to say, that Deny gave two natives plugs
of tobacco and promised them another drink from his
rum-flask if they’d lead us to the den where the girl
resided. For I must tell you that we had found out
by the merest chance that the girl did not live with
her parent, but dwelt at the other end of the village,
where the high chiefs resided.</p>

<p class='c009'>“As the natives led us across the cleared village space,
we wondered what the girl would think to see us so
eager to seek her presence. At last we stood outside a
thatched den, just on the outskirts of the village.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘She in there, Marama, savvy?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“In a moment Deny and I made up our minds and
entered the hut. The first thing that I did was to upset
a cradle wherein lay two whitish-looking kiddies.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_307'>307</span>“‘Look like damned half-caste kids,’ said Deny, as
we cursed and made a swift attempt to pick them up
before the distracted mother appeared. They opened
their reddish mouths like two young crows, and made
terrific caw-like sounds. Deny put his hand over one’s
mouth!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Suddenly we felt a draught, the tappa-curtain was
flung aside, the white girl stood before us, her eyes
blazing as we both held the kids! She really <i>did</i> look
like a wild girl, as she stood there before us with her
mouth open, in <i>déshabillé</i>, an old torn sulu dangling to
her thighs. For a moment I felt embarrassed as I looked
at her bare bosom. Then I swiftly realized that she
did not understand the novelty of the sight,—a girl of
our race dressed like that, showing so much of what
should have been her secret toilet, to say the least.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps she saw the romantic light in Deny’s eyes
as she stared up at our flushed faces. Anyway, she
cooled down, and asked us into her homestead.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then she looked up at us in a startled way, and
said, ‘You be killer; go way! go way!’</p>

<p class='c009'>“That was the first thing she said, as we got out of
earshot of the sly-looking old hags who were leaning
against the palms smoking cigarettes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘We’ve come to save you!—to take you away from
this village,’ whispered Deny, giving her a ravishing
look. ‘Take you away to another country where the
white men and women live,—understand?—savvy?’ continued
Deny, as the girl looked up and simply stared
at us.</p>

<p class='c009'>“At first we thought it might be some haunting remembrance
of her childhood days in England that made
her stare so. It may have been so. However, the only
response she made was to put forth her hand and commence
to caress the pendant, the brass compass, that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_308'>308</span>dangled at the end of my silver watch chain! Then
she giggled and showed us <i>her</i> babies!</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Yours!’ almost yelled Deny.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The scales fell from our eyes when we learnt from
her own lips that those pallid, demon-like-looking kids
were hers—twins too!</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Where’s he?’ we both ejaculated in a tense whisper,
as we looked around.</p>

<p class='c009'>“She shook her head, did not understand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘The old man, your husband?—the father of the
kids?’ said Deny, trying to make her understand.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Pointing to the floor, she said, ‘He go under, goodee
job tooer!’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Dead!’ was Deny’s and my comment. Nor did
we shed any tears over the dead heathen’s demise, I
can tell you.</p>

<p class='c009'>“There she stood before us, innocent-looking as a
child, a splendid specimen of what an English girl was
like when reared up as a savage. Even as I watched,
I thought of the interest she would create in the souls
of those who went in for anthropology.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I discerned at a glance that she had the instincts of
a white woman the world over. As she stared at us
she hastily put her hand up to her hair to see if the
hibiscus blossoms were in an attractive position. As
she squatted on the mat and boldly looked into our eyes,
she pulled her picturesque raiment down over the curves
of her knees. ‘That’s something that a native woman
wouldn’t do,’ was my mental comment. That one little
action convinced me that there is an inherent modesty
in women of the white races that is not conspicuous in
many of the brown races. For, <i>how</i> did she know that
women of our race wore long dresses? All the native
women about her wore barely anything at all! Besides,
there was the swift, instinctive action of an act that could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_309'>309</span>only be the result of <i>inherent</i> modesty. Knowing the
chance I had of testing the difference between the white
and the brown races, I went through all sorts of artful
dodges to find out the various shades of her character.
I put my hand out in a caressing way, softly touching
her fingers so that she might be assured that I was
there only out of friendship. Deny did the same.</p>

<p class='c009'>“To our delight she repsonded by saying, ‘Yorana,
Papalagi,’ and then, in a soft, fawning, cat-like way,
returned the caress, touched my wrist, looked into my
eyes, and murmured, ‘Oh, whi! whi, nicer,’ alluding to
the whiteness of my flesh just up under my coat-sleeve.
Then, in a really fascinating way, she admired the
smoothness of our boyish faces; put her fingers through
my golden hair;—I had hair then.” (He was bald as
a badger as he sat there telling us these things.) “Then
Deny took the flask from his pocket and, to my surprise,
asked her to take a nip of rum! She gave one sip, and
made a wry face as she spat the liquid out.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I looked into her eyes, held her hand, and said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Wouldn’t you like to leave this village and go across
the seas to your own people, see the big cities, large
buildings?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“She only stared at me. I saw that it was all Greek
to her. Then I tried to explain civilization to her. I told
her that women wore beautiful silken robes to the feet,
robes that were adorned with flashing gems. Her eyes
sparkled with wonder for a while. She seemed to show
true interest only when I described English life, told
of the comfortable, cosy homes, the hearth-fires in cold
weather, and of the little children. Deny looked up at
me, noticed my earnest manner, and thought I was mad.
So he said after. Sanga squatted just behind us the
whole time, staring at the girl with wonder in her eyes,
and never said one word.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_310'>310</span>“As I told her these things, I watched for some evidence
of a desire in her heart to come with us; but the
only effect it seemed to have on her was that which one
notices on a child when it listens to a fairy story. There
was something infinitely sad about it all as she sat there—a
girl of our race, lost to the world, irreclaimable,
doomed to live on in that hell of a village,—a girl with
natural beauty shining from her soft, almost wistful-looking
eyes. The wind blew gently through the doorway,
the palms sighed mournfully on the mountain slopes,
and it seemed that the very zephyrs caressed her with
sorrow as they touched the picturesque robe she had put
on since we had arrived.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I can never tell you how Deny and I appealed to
that girl, beseeching her to come away with us. For a
moment she gazed at us as though in grief, then she put
forth her hand and appealed to Deny to give her one
of his coat buttons. In a moment my pal had ripped
a button off and handed it to her. She held it up in
the ray of sunlight that trickled through the doorway,
and gave a childish cry of pleasure.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Look at her feet,’ said Deny.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I had never seen such pretty feet before. The nails
were like pearls, and, through the foot having never been
cramped up in boots, the toes were exquisitely curved,
the lower contours running up and finishing at the ankles
in a charming way. Deny took the liberty of tenderly
holding her leg up so that I might admire the curves
of the calf, the perfect roundness of the knee. She kept
a wary eye on him: I’m <i>sure</i> that <i>was</i> the look that I
noticed in her eyes. Then, on hearing our impassioned
exclamations, and seeing the appreciative glances of our
eyes over the beauty of her shape, she gave in; vanity
was stronger than modesty. Then Deny spoilt it all; as
he held the leg in a graceful position, he deliberately
<span class='pageno' id='Page_311'>311</span>kissed the knee! That’s what my eyes saw! Deny swore
that it was a mistake, that he fell forward. But I knew
Deny well enough, and never before saw anything so
deliberate in the way of impassioned acts.</p>

<p class='c009'>“From that moment she became reserved in her attitude
and manner. But, still, I noticed that her eyes
softly gleamed as Deny and I and Sanga crept out of the
door to answer the command of Yoraka. It was nearly
dusk then, and we had to be in Yoraka’s presence by
dark.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was quite dark when we again stood outside
Yoraka’s palatial hut, hesitating before we entered.
Then, seeing no way out of it, we entered that home
of licentiousness. All the hanging coco-nut-oil lamps
were ablaze as we stood there once more in the presence
of Yoraka, the native girls all staring at us. I think that
I preferred the sight of them to the drunken ribaldry of
that British heathen. There was something terrible in
his gaze as he looked up at us. I saw the domineering
gaze of savagery staring from those cold, blue, British
eyes. All the inherent might of my own race—the might
that had overthrown nation after nation, conquered the
world, making all the primitive tribes suppliant at her
Imperial Feet—seemed to shine forth in the terrible
glare of that red-bearded Britisher as he stared at us
with <i>sober</i> eyes! By the dim light of the oil-lamps I
discerned the tattoo that marked his massive chest and
shoulders. It seemed impossible that he was a white
man at all, so villainous did he look. Then he commenced
to ask a thousand questions as to what we wanted
with him. We told him we didn’t want anything of him.
Deny came to the rescue like a brick, for Yoraka was getting
fierce; he handed him the remainder of his rum.
In a moment the man seemed to forget his suspicions;
he smacked his lips, looked up, and gripped Deny’s hand.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_312'>312</span>After that he drank more toddy. He was soon drivelling
drunk again. I shall never forget that night if I live
to be a thousand years old. As the tribal girls waited
on him, he roared forth disgusting songs—putting words
of his own to them—and at each loathsome epithet spat
up in the faces of the frightened harem-women. Looking
up into my face he chuckled and roared out uproariously,
making remarks about civilized life.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Go back ter your ole Queen on the Thames! He!
he! I’d giver ’er——</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Ugh! Ugh! who’ thater girl? She belonger you?
I eater better girler than that on toast! Savvy?’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Still I did not gather the terrible import of his remarks
as he looked up, drivelling spittle from betel-nut
between his clenched black teeth, and pinched pretty
Sanga’s soft arms!</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Comer way! Comer way! Master, don’t your
know?’ whispered little Sanga, inclining her curly head
sideways as she slightly lifted her pretty eyes, giving me
a meaning look.</p>

<p class='c009'>“But still Deny stared and I stared, as Yoraka
grovelled on his belly and made loathsome remarks to the
women around him. Once more he sought Deny’s conversation,
and plied him with that vile toddy stuff. The
night was far advanced when the great climax came.
Yoraka was poking Deny in the ribs, and Deny was nudging
Yoraka. The savage Britisher’s brain had once more
become reminiscent, for he was shouting and yelling disgusting
ribaldry about his memories of London, Fleet
Street, the Strand, and Marble Arch. Then he seemed
to become breathless through his own obscenity. He
drivelled at the mouth, his head swaying like an imbecile
as he lurched forward on his stomach. Then, leaning
forward, he took hold of Sanga’s little robe, looked with
some terrible meaning into her eyes, took hold of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_313'>313</span>arm’s soft, semi-white flesh between his thumb and forefinger—and
pinched it deliciously!</p>

<p class='c009'>“His hideous mouth was emitting spittle from between
the gaps of his filthy betel-nut-blackened teeth. I distinctly
saw him give a fiendish, hungry leer at the girl
as he stroked her leg and said something very unguardedly
about ‘Long pig!’ and chuckled ‘Kai! kai!
I eater nicer girler!’ He was looking up into Deny’s
astonished face as he said that. Then he lifted his
drunken eyes to my comrade and said, ‘You giver girler
me? I make you great chief here!’</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Heavens!’ gasped Deny, as he looked at me.
‘Why, he’s a cannibal!’</p>

<p class='c009'>“Before I knew, or even realized the terror of the
whole business, Deny had expressed his horror of that
fiend’s remarks in a most forcible way. It all looked like
some unreal picture of horror as Yoraka crouched there,
grovelling on his stomach, the rows of coco-nut-oil lamps
sending a ghastly, unreal glare over his face and on the
barbarian furniture, boxes, ornamental matting, calabashes,
and human skulls that hung on the walls. He
was paralyzed!—as though he’d had a stroke and had
died with his mouth and eyes still half-open with astonishment.
The native girls, who had been bringing in
platters of cooked yams and gourds of toddy, stood
transfixed, like wonderful life-like statues of terra-cotta
hue, so still did they all stand there in the dim light,
some with arms still outstretched, one leg placed forward,
one arm uplifted, their eyes glassy, petrified with
astonishment—so sudden was the onslaught!</p>

<p class='c009'>“That representative of a British criminal in savage
‘state,’ rolled his eyes thrice; he seemed to strive to
believe his own senses; his mouth was wide open with
astonishment and pain, revealing his sharp, dirty teeth,
as crash! a second blow knocked them down his throat!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_314'>314</span>“‘Ugh! Ugh!’ came like vomited sound from that
devil’s entrails as Deny stood there at his full height,
his eyes afire with rage and drink. My helmet hat was
bashed down over my eyes as I leapt forward to stay
Deny from quite killing our host. In a flash I saw that
Deny’s impulsiveness would place us at the mercy of the
whole tribe. But what cared old Deny?—not a damn!
He proceeded to demolish Yoraka’s palavana. The native
girls, seeing their master prostrated, recovered and
bolted! Catching hold of the central post, that was the
mainstay for the hut’s support, Deny tore it right out
of the ground—crash! the roof had fallen on the top
of us!</p>

<p class='c009'>“In the pandemonium that followed, amid the wild
yells of Yoraka, the screams of his concubines and children,
I could hardly collect my senses. Sanga was still
trembling beside me, was clutching my hand. We were
on our stomachs, the heavy débris, planks, etc., nearly
smothering us.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Comer, Master!’ murmured Sanga, as she tugged
my coat and wriggled on. By some wonderful instinct
she found a pathway through that terror-stricken group
of clutching figures, all huddled in mad terror to get out
of the smothering débris into the open air. Outside the
night was pitch-black, not a star relieving the intense
overhead dark as I peered around, calling aloud to my
comrade, ‘Deny! Deny!’</p>

<p class='c009'>“As I stood there, hesitating, for I could not rush off
into the forest and leave a pal like that, I felt something
brush against me, like the rushing of a wind. It was a
regiment of those damned cannibals. They had rushed
forth from their huts to rescue their master, the White
Roko, from the murderous hands of the two Papalagis.
They were evidently seeking to locate the exact spot of
our host’s late homestead!</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_315'>315</span>“‘Comer way, Master! They killer you!’ said little
Sanga, as she tugged my hand, and I glared round in the
darkness, envying that little one’s all-seeing eyes in the
gloom. I felt the exultation of battle seize my soul. I
no longer regretted the fact that Deny had pulled down
that homestead of unbridled lust about the b—— cannibal
Englishman’s ears! I rushed forward, calling for
my pal. Suddenly I collided with the soft, naked bodies
of those who were seeking Deny and myself. I heard
Deny’s voice just by me. ‘Thank God he’s all right,’
was my mental comment. Then, to my astonishment, I
heard Deny roaring forth an old sea chanty at the top
of his voice as he clubbed away at the natives in the
darkness! ‘O for Rio Grande!’ came to my ears as I
too entered the fray, and wondered if the whole business
was some nightmare. My strength was superhuman.
For I tell you I was in a terrible funk, and there’s nothing
like true, unadulterated funk to make a man brave as
a lion, and fight splendidly for his own life!</p>

<p class='c009'>“I had no weapon whatsoever to defend myself with.
Deny had a club, I know. Feeling a mass of tangled
arms clutching for me in the dark, I made a dive and,
by good luck, caught what I meant to use as a club—it
was a soft, slippery, nude savage! I felt the bones creak
as I swung that living weapon round and round and
aimed unseen blows at the bodies of the savages
who tried to catch hold of me in that inky darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“‘Go it, pal!’ yelled Deny. Crash! came the sound
of his falling club, then a groan; another had gone under.
Again and again came howls of pain to my ears as the
natives fell to the forest floor before my tremendous
onslaught as I wielded that soft, bulky weapon—a weapon
that gave terrified shrieks as it attempted to save itself,
for the poor devil made frantic clutches at the bodies
<span class='pageno' id='Page_316'>316</span>I swung him towards as his hands tore at their mops of
hair in terror.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Then Deny came to my assistance, just in time too.
But though I’d got a nasty knock on the head and nearly
fell, I managed to follow Deny and Sanga as they called
me. Then the three of us rushed away down the slopes.
By daybreak we were miles away from that cursed village.
And I don’t think we stopped more than an hour
to rest before we got down to the seaboard.</p>

<p class='c009'>“When we arrived back in Levuka we made up our
minds to go out to the man-o’-war boat that was lying
out in the bay, and tell them about Yoraka and his
daughter up there in the Kai Tholos village. We were
determined to get our own back off that bloodthirsty
Britisher. We decided to let the matter slide for a day
or so. Deny had got a blow on the back of the head
during the mêlée and wanted to sleep for a day or so
before he had any more excitement.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It was during this interval that that happened which
is history now. It was like this. Some sailors from a
man-o’-war—three, I think—had gone off up in the mountains
on a spree. They were never heard of again. So
Commander Goodenough, of the British man-o’-war lying
off Levuka, sent a crew of Jack Tars up to the tribal
villages of the mountains to give them a lesson and see
if they could hear anything of the missing men. They
blew the Kai Tholos villages to smithereens! And it is
common knowledge amongst the missionaries and traders
to this day that, when they searched amongst the débris,
to see if they could find any trace of their comrades,
they came across the body of a white girl, clad in barbarian
costume and riddled with bullets. Just by her
side was the body of a white man, clad in a sulu gown.
He was tattooed and sunburnt, but there was no mistake
about his being a white man. They buried them both up
<span class='pageno' id='Page_317'>317</span>there in the mountains, and put a cross on the girl’s
grave; no name, just the date of the day when they had
found her. Then they buried the man by her side, and,
as he was a Britisher, they sounded the <i>Last Post</i> and
fired a volley over his grave. And Deny wrapped him
up in the Union Jack!”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Well, now! if that’s not the irony of fate, and the
way of this world all over!” was all I could mutter,
as G—— knocked the ashes out of his pipe and finished
his story, took his flute from his pocket, and began to
warble sweetly, “Scenes that are brightest.”</p>

<p class='c009'>G—— was a kind of hero to O’Hara and myself after
that. We followed him about, and felt the glamour of
romance shine whenever we stood in his remarkable
presence. I think it was the very next day that he took
us down the river, then across country to a native village,
and introduced us both to a fine-looking, native woman.
She treated us in good style when G—— told her that
we were his friends. I noticed that she looked up into
his eyes as though she were some sister of his.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Who is she?” I ventured to ask him at last.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s her,—the kid we took up into the Kai Tholos
mountains that time,—little Sanga,” he replied.</p>

</div>
<p class='c017'>Poetry’s Legitimate Child—Music’s Fairyland—A Civilized
Old Man of the Sea—A Clerical Hat is the Symbol
of Modern Religion.</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c008'>HAD it not been for men like D—— and many other
striking personalities who enlivened the Organization,
we should have cleared out of it sooner than we did.
We were considerably in debt to the host of that Sailors’
Home, too. There were no certified bailiffs in the South
Seas, but if one’s account was overdue, credit was taken
out of the debtor in a novel manner. Bones discovered
that one of his customers owed him about fifty dollars
for board.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Goying ter pye up?” said he laconically.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hain’t gotter cent ter bless meself with till I gets
an adwance note,” replied the stranded one. There was
no further parley on the subject. Bones simply caught
the culprit by the scruff of the neck, placed one knee in
the middle of his back, and then, crash! sent the unfortunate
devil through the South Sea bankruptcy court
at the end of his boot—right through the open door—bang!
on to the sward. And the discharged bankrupt,
out of debt, went his way, unworried, free from all his
late liabilities. Once or twice there was a fight when
the members took sides on behalf of someone who could
not pay his way; hats, rum mugs, and tin pots would
fly about, but it was soon all over. They would bind
up each other’s wounds, shake hands all round, and end
up in a tremendous drinking bout. Sometimes highly-cultured
men would step out of the great unknown into
<span class='pageno' id='Page_319'>319</span>that shanty’s door—actors, musicians, poets, and sad-looking
literary men, who would imbibe rum and prove
highly entertaining. Some had fine voices, others recited
<i>Hamlet</i>, or made the place hum with laughter ere they
drank up, clinked their glass in some toast, and then, to
the cry of “God speed,” once more departed out into the
great unknown.</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Hara and I would go wandering through the forests,
visiting the various tribal villages by the coffee plantations.
On these wanderings we were accompanied by
our faithful little bodyguard, Soogy, a little native half-caste
boy. He was a mystical little beggar, not only in
his ways but in his origin. No one knew where he came
from.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You no father? No mother, Soogy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>He shook his curly head and said: “No; me come
down, dropper from sky!”</p>

<p class='c009'>He had beautiful eyes, and by the paleness of his complexion
one easily concluded that he had European blood
in his veins. He was about eight years old. Whenever
I played the violin he would at once put his little chin
on his knees and commence singing. Even G——, who
had had a lot to do with native youngsters, said that
Soogy was a wonder. I had no doubt at all that the
child was a genius. His mother must have lived in a
cave within sound of the seas just before he was born,
for music was alive in his soul. His brain was splashed
over with moonlight, there was no doubt about that.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where did you learn that melody, Soogy?” I’d say,
when he suddenly burst forth and sang some sweet
strain with a lingering, haunting note of sadness running
through it. He would simply look up, shake his curly
head, and wonder what I meant by asking him where
his little brain learned its own mysterious music from.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Looks older than he is,” said O’Hara. “Got eyes
<span class='pageno' id='Page_320'>320</span>like a blessed girl,” my pal continued, as Soogy fondled
my hand and stared up into my face, a weird look in
his pretty eyes. I could not make it out; but when that
kiddie came up to me in the forest, or crept into my
hut-room, an old broken-down shack near the river, the
world would change, the sun shine with a mysterious
shadowy light, a kind of poetic atmosphere pervading
the deep gloom of the woods. I was not surprised when
O’Hara said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Begorra, pal, I wish that kiddie would keep away;
he’s like some little beggar of a ghost hanging around.
I’m sure he’ll bring us bad luck.”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t be a fool. How can a little child influence
our ways or alter what must happen to-morrow?” I
replied, as the child noticed the angry look in my comrade’s
eyes, and looked up to see if I too wanted him
to go away.</p>

<p class='c009'>I didn’t send him away, though. To tell the truth,
I came under the mystic spell of that weird child of the
forest. Sometimes I’d go out of earshot of all the world,
accompanied by that mysterious little beggar, and, under
the banyans by the lagoon, as fireflies danced in the
bamboos, I’d play the violin while he danced. Even
the cockatoos, as they cried out, “Ka ka—ka to wooh!
ka! ka! ka! to wooh!” seemed to have come under
the influence of Soogy’s songs. Somehow, the thought
of the world beyond the solitude of that forest seemed to
fall away; I would half imagine that Soogy and I sat
side by side in some mossy fairy-wood of a world far
beyond the stars. We would seem to be two mighty
<i>maestros</i> of heathenland, both of us enthroned on the
highest pinnacles of fame as I sat there, that weird little
kiddie singing wondrous melodies and dancing. It was
nothing strange to me when the Old-Man-Frog looked
out of the moonlit marsh flowers in surprise, opened its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_321'>321</span>weird-slit mouth, and chanted a wonderful accompaniment
in perfect <i>tempo</i> as Soogy danced. Then some
strange thing with a green, semi-human face would peep
out of the <i>vatu</i> weeds and clang its tiny cymbals.</p>

<p class='c009'>Knowing that the commonplace conception of reality
does not exist at all, and that we mortals only see a
nose, a mouth, a glance of the eyes—indeed, the Universe
itself—in the relation that it assumes by contact with
one’s inner self, I felt no wonder as Soogy danced beneath
the moonlit palms, no Soogy at all, but a something
weirdly beautiful dancing as I played the violin
in the shadowland of my own mad eyes, a <i>something</i>
that looked to me like two fallen stars fixed in a wonderful
little receptacle called a skull poised on swaying, dusky
limbs, and possessing a sweet-voiced tongue.</p>

<p class='c009'>The very forest trees became etherealized to my eyes
as their big heads moved and sighed to the soughing
night winds, humming out half-forgotten memories of
cherished things. And when those old trees tenderly
waved their arms over the weird child, then took partners,
and commenced to waltz slowly, I didn’t wonder
much; I still played on, wailing forth the magical melodies
that Soogy sang to my listening ears. It was clear
enough that the child had never been taught dancing
in any mortal school, for, as his small limbs moved in
rhythmical motion, they swerved not one bit from the
<i>tempo</i> of the swaying forest flowers as the shifting fingers
of the zephyrs tossed them gently one way, and then
softly the other way. And my chagrin was complete
when I realized that my cultured ear served only to
empower me with discernment enough to know that, as
a conductor of the most subtle movements in that great
orchestra of the forest-night and mighty, waltzing trees,
I was simply nowhere where that conductor, an Old-Man-Frog,
was concerned, as, with his wonderful clappers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_322'>322</span>going “Click-er-tee-clack! currh! currh! clack-er to-clack,”
he got the most marvellous, subtle musical effects
from that wonderful ensemble. The pathos of the tiny
streamlet’s voice as it hurried by us, then ran with fright
under the forest trees and leapt into the sea, convinced me
that I was beautifully mad—as mad as I am now deadly
sane. It may have been some inherited madness, or
possibly Soogy had some magnetic influence over me. I
know not which it was. But I <i>do</i> know that, sometimes
when I lay half asleep under the ndrala trees of the
moonlit forest, he would sit singing wonderful songs for
my half-sleeping ears—songs that would seem to drift
my life across into unremembered ages till I became one
with the stars and the music of the infinite. The very
caves along the shore of my bedroom floor seemed to
sing out some old sorrow as he came, night after night,
creeping out of the forest like some little phantom child,
to make my mossy bed!</p>

<p class='c009'>Such a one was Soogy. I never dreamed that such
sorrow could come to one through knowing a little child—sorrow
that made my heart ache for many a day. The
whole trouble came about through an old man suddenly
arriving at the Organization just when O’Hara and I
had determined to get a ship and clear out for Nuka
Hiva. We were both tired out, had been sauntering
about amongst the villages, and were glad enough to
get back to the Organization’s hospitable roof; but, just
as we were approaching the door, we heard a terrible
row in progress. It appeared that someone had robbed
the aforesaid old man of his valuable pocketbook. There
he stood, by the wide-open door, waving his hands in
despair, shouting out:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll give a hundred pounds to the one who finds my
pocketbook.”</p>

<p class='c009'>He was a strange-looking old fellow. He wore a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_323'>323</span>clerical hat, a stiff, high collar, and grey side-whiskers;
and he was purple to the forehead as he stood there just
beneath the low-roof saloon, shouting:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Where’s my pocketbook?”</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Hara and I stared with astonishment to see that
old gent, so fashionably attired, a bullet hole in his hat,
standing up for himself, defiantly facing the whole
damned crew of sun-tanned, villainous-looking men as
they thrust their faces, chins, and fists out of the door,
and looked scornfully at the grand old man! Suddenly
Tanner Bolt, who had his nose missing and had a face
like a diseased Chinaman, stepped forward and knocked
the old fellow’s hat off. O’Hara and I, not liking such
a cowardly act, immediately sided with the new-comer,
who had sought protection from justice in that forest
hermitage. Bones regarded O’Hara and me rather
fiercely for a moment, then, whipping his revolver out,
turned to the men and roared:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ll shoot the first God-damned rogue who touches
any of ’em.”</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the hullabaloo subsided. After that O’Hara and
I made tracks outside, as G—— went in to have his
nap on the saloon settee. The old gent followed us
outside.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A lot of rogues and thieves, that’s what they are,”
he almost squeaked, as he shook his fist at the half-hidden
den, his false teeth dropping on the sward, so violent
was his rage as he shook from head to feet.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Do you chaps belong to them?” said he, as he surveyed
us critically.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No, thank you!”</p>

<p class='c009'>The emphatic note of my reply seemed to change the
old man’s manner immediately, and make him glad to
give that confidence that so relieves mortals when they
have the world against them.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_324'>324</span>“A man enticed me up here from S——, telling me
that I could wait here in comfort till the ’Frisco boat
arrived at S——. I want to get to San Francisco; got
business there,” he hurriedly added, as he readjusted his
pince-nez.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a bit of an effort for us to keep serious-looking
and hide the fact that we well knew that ’Frisco was the
much-sought high road to the No-Extradition Ports.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Get me out of this hole and I’ll give you a present
of fifty pounds,” said the old fellow, as he gripped my
hand and peered about in a neurotic manner.</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Hara and I looked into one another’s eyes. “Fifty
pounds!” I heard O’Hara’s soul gasp as mine re-echoed
it. We had been on long voyages, working like slaves
for a mere pittance too!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t say a word to anyone. I can get you away
from here safely,” said O’Hara, giving him a quiet wink
as Bones came out of the Organization door.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Here’s yer d—— pocketbook,” said he, as he threw
something in the direction of the old gent.</p>

<p class='c009'>That aged, fugitive bank-manager nearly fell forward
on to his knees in thanksgiving when he opened the
pocketbook and discovered his papers intact.</p>

<p class='c009'>As Soogy came rushing out of the forest and commenced
to gambol by us, Bones called the old man, took
him under the breadfruits, and whispered to him. We
saw the old gent take Bones’ hand impulsively in his
own and vigorously shake it. Bones had some sense of
honour, and I have no doubt that he had told the new-comer
that he would see that he was not molested by the
members of the shanty again.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was wonderful how everything quieted down after
that bit of excitement. The old gent imbibed a considerable
amount of whisky, told the guilty men that he
forgave them, shook their hands across the long benchtable,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_325'>325</span>and drank their health. The humour of it all
even struck those seasoned criminals. I saw them grin
from ear to ear. It was a sight to see those rows of
fierce, bearded faces as they sat there, clad in their red
shirts and belted pants, the whole scene dimly lit up
by the swinging candles that hung in the empty gin
bottles just overhead, every sinful eye alert as the old
man shook his finger.</p>

<p class='c009'>That old gent’s main weakness was whisky and rum.
Most probably it was the main cause of his taking the
desperate chance that brought him as a fugitive from
justice across the seas. He sang a song to those rough
men; his voice was strangely mellow and sweet, becoming
pathetic as the fumes got thicker in his sinful
head—who knows what thoughts flashed through his
drunken dreams?</p>

<p class='c009'>Tanner Bolt, Lively Humper, and Jimmy Scratch
played their mouth-organs and banjos as the wild chorus
of those men shook the shanty. Then Soogy came in
and did a dance on the table. I noticed that even those
drunken men seemed to come under the spell of that
kid’s song and dance. As for the old gent, he kept
taking out his watch, keying it up, and staring with his
mouth open as he watched the child’s bright eyes and his
wonderful dancing. I think the old man was trying
to recall his senses, wondering who he was, what he
was doing there with those wild-looking men as they
encored that mysterious child. Then his besotted head
fell forward and he dropped off asleep. And when I
think of all that happened through him, how the innocent
were punished for the sins of the guilty, I wish that he
had never awakened again. But there, I mustn’t be too
hard on him; he never made himself, and he suffered too.</p>

  <h2 id='ch18' class='c007'>CHAPTER XVIII. RETROSPECT</h2>
</div>
<p class='c017'>The Modern Old Man of the Sea—Fifty Pounds!—A
Human Octopus—Adrift at Sea—Sorrow—Saved—In
Tonga—Our Old Man’s last Hiding-place—Retrospect.</p>
<p class='drop-capa0_3_0_65 c008'>THE perspective of things as seen after a lapse of
years seems gifted with a visionary light that has
no relation to the normal outlook of the intellect. The
most commonplace objects and incidents, when seen and
thought over in the pale light of memory, become tinged
with that indefinable glamour, that something which men
call poetry. A wind-blown ship far at sea with trailing
spars and torn sails beating its way into the sunset; a
bird travelling silently across a foreign tropic sky; a
wild girl singing by a lagoon; a dead tree tossing its
arms on a windy hill; an old gentleman with a little
clerical hat bashed over his eyes; the remembrance of a
tiny, golden-eyed girl, with a bit of blue ribbon in her hair
as she sprang into your farewell arms when you said
good-bye and went off, a boy, on your first voyage to
sea—I say, all these things seem to be the landmarks,
the promontories of the shores one has hugged as one
sailed across the wild seas of life.</p>

<p class='c009'>And, in looking back, that old gent of the South Sea
Organization seems to stand out, not so much as a
wicked, eccentric individual, as he does of a type that
represents nine-tenths of the men whom one is doomed
to knock up against in one’s pilgrimage along this shore
of hope and sudden chills, wrecks, and buffeted dreams.</p>

<p class='c009'>I know that that old man came to us in the guise of a
benefactor who would bestow wealth on O’Hara and on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_327'>327</span>me, whereas he turned out to be a Nemesis wrapt up
in the vilest disguise, a Nemesis who seemed to take some
vindictive delight in the frailties of youth, and was guilty
of unwarrantable cruelty to a child’s innocence. I have
sometimes thought that neither he, nor the Organization
itself, ever existed in this world as men know things to
exist; that I once lived in a phantasmagorial world of
ghostly sunlight and shadow that was haunted by an
aged man who wore side-whiskers, clung to my back
like an Old Man of the Sea, and successfully throttled
my faith in supreme goodness. It was our lack of funds
and the old man’s abundant wealth that brought the whole
business about. And, though I know that the lack of
funds on the one side and an abundance of funds on
the other side has brought about the direst disasters beneath
the sun, still, I feel that the sorrow that came to
us through that old fellow is worth recording.</p>

<p class='c009'>I think it was the very next day that O’Hara and I
saw our chance of luring the old gentleman away from
the Organization to see if he was really in earnest about
that fifty pounds he said he would give to the first one
who got him safely away. In the little that we had seen
of him we observed that he was weak where native girls
and dancing-women were concerned. When O’Hara had
acquainted him with the fact that there was a great
tribal-dance on down in the village of Takarora, that
the chiefs were going to pow-wow and the <i>meke-girls</i> eat
fire and dance, he took hold of our hands, and begged
us to take him to see the sight.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’ve read a bit about these people in books, but, dear
boys, I’d really like to see the grandeur of primitive life
in the natural state.” So spake that old man. Then off
we went, with the old gent in our company, down the
forest track.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I never <i>did</i> see a place like this,” said O’Hara, as we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_328'>328</span>both gave a startled jump—two dusky, faun-like creatures
had suddenly peered through the tasi-ferns and
exotic convolvulus festoons, and, seeing our white faces,
had given a scream and sped off to their homestead in
the pagan village. The old gentleman placed his hand
on his heart, took a swill from his brandy-flask, and
said it was enough to give one syncope to live in such
a blasted heathenland. Then he reshaped his clerical hat,
that had been bashed in by a banyan bough, and once
more followed us through the interminable growth of
camphor, sage-palm, and all that mysterious assemblage
of twisting trunks and vines that nature fashions where
the sunlight burns with fiery heat.</p>

<p class='c009'>When we got to the native village the girls, clad in
decorative festival costume, were dancing away in full
swing. On the forum-lecture-stump that faced the village
green stood some pagan philosopher, spouting for all he
was worth about the new edict passed by the missionaries—prohibition
of rum-selling on Sundays.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What’s he saying, Soogy?” said I, as that haunting
kiddie rushed up to us, for we never could get rid of him.
Then Soogy told me, in pigeon English, that the old
pagan chief was shouting:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Down with the brown man’s burden! Down with
the cursed white man wrapped in clothes!”</p>

<p class='c009'>I must admit he looked a nasty old heathen as he put
forth his dark chin, lifted his face to the forest roof, and
called on the old heathen gods to hear the prayers of their
faithful child. When he had finished he took a huge
nip from the kava calabash, and the native girls commenced
to give a fascinating two-step whilst the next
chief oiled his hair and prepared for a speech.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Now’s your chance!” said I to O’Hara, for the old
gentleman seemed in the most convivial of moods as he
stared at the dancing maids. I confess that I was not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_329'>329</span>good at giving a hint to a man who had promised fifty
pounds if a certain thing was done for him and had
apparently forgotten all about his promise. As O’Hara
sidled up to the old gentleman’s side, I remained within
comfortable earshot.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hard times these,” said my pal, as he looked first
towards the old man and then towards the dancers. Still
the old fellow stared in a vacant way, fingered and readjusted
his pince-nez as the stout chiefess did a most
peculiar somersault while performing the heathen tango.
O’Hara got desperate; it got on his mettle to be ignored
like that. He sidled up a little closer to the old man,
and I distinctly heard him say, as he stared in an absentminded
way in front of himself: “Hard times these;
wish there was a chance of getting fifty pounds, somehow!”</p>

<p class='c009'>It wanted some pluck to give a hint like that, I can tell
you. The old fellow had a freezing way with him too.
Polish does hang on one when one is born where the
missing bank-managers hail from. Yet O’Hara did the
trick; for the old fellow stared on for a long time as
though he’d not heard a word, then he turned quietly
to my comrade and said: “I suppose you really could
get me safely away to Lakemba, so that I could catch
the next boat?”</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Hara at once unfolded part of his scheme to the old
chap, who seemed mighty pleased at the way O’Hara
presented the matter to him. The scheme was that we
should hire one of the large, full outrigger-canoes from
the natives, and paddle the old man across the mile or so
of ocean that separated us from Lakemba. We happened
to know that at Lakemba there was a schooner due to
sail for Honolulu, and the old fellow knew as well as we
that it was an easy matter to get a boat from Honolulu
to San Francisco. So the matter was arranged.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_330'>330</span>Then O’Hara went off to the shore village, made all
his plans, hired a large outrigger-canoe that could hold
twenty warriors, and decided that at the first opportunity
we should clear out with the old man, for we thought
that we could kill two birds with one stone and get away
to Honolulu in the same schooner. But since man proposes
and God disposes, nothing came off as arranged,
excepting that we did succeed in getting away from that
place. The old man seemed as pleased as Punch after
that scheme had been so rosily presented to him. When
we got back to the shanty we discovered that the old
gentleman had presented each member with a five-pound
note, and that they were all drinking his health from
the large barrel of rum he had specially purchased for
them. They all put out their horny hands and one after
the other gripped his hand, looking quite affected as he
called them “My dear sons,” and ordered the native girls
to serve out the rum. I saw his old eyes shine as he
looked into their wicked faces. They were not all villainous-looking;
some were as honest as the sunlight, were
castaway sailormen, or traders who had arrived at that
Organization as <i>bona fide</i> travellers who would rest there
a while.</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c009'>A special concert was given on the old chap’s behalf
that night. The native women from Tambu-tambu came
in and danced on the saloon <i>pae-pae</i>. Oaths and wild
reminiscences were in full swing. The old gentleman
became loquacious, sat with lifted finger telling Billy
Bode a naughty story, and everyone listened with deep
respect. For those wild men instinctively felt that the
old fellow was an <i>oasis</i> in the desert for them. He had
promised them twenty pounds apiece and another barrel
of the best rum ere he left the Organization’s roof, consequently
his interest and safety were <i>their</i> interest and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_331'>331</span>safety, and when suddenly a tremendous crash came at
the Organization’s front door, they rose <i>en masse</i>! In
a flash they saw the promised rum and “twenty pounds
apiece” in danger. In a moment they were on the defensive.
Piff! the packs of half-shuffled cards dropped
on the table bench; puff! went forty bearded lips, and
out went forty tallow candles—candles that were suspended
from the low roof in gin bottles. That old gent
must have thought a human octopus with ten thousand
arms and legs had seized him! Every “man jack” of
them had made a grab at him in the darkness—crash!
down went the vast lid of the emergency barrel; they
had lifted him bodily to the roof, and then, with a mighty
thrust, so that he was sure to fit in (for he was stout)
they had crashed him into that gigantic tub!</p>

<p class='c009'>Someone opened the door and let the moonlight in.
It gleamed across the stubbily whiskered, wild-looking
faces of the men of the shanty, faces flushed with drink
and the thought that the prisoner in the tub, who had
promised such wealth, might be seized and taken down
to Suva in chains! It seemed that fate stared with determined
eyes when those scarred faces looked on the
new-comers, who stood like shadows at the doorway.
There was no doubt about it; they were men-hunters!
Then there was a lot of bustling and whispering, fearful
efforts, and big bribes were promised to allay suspicion, as
eight of the stoutest Organization members sat on the
lid of the tub, grim determination on their faces, a resolve
in their eyes to sell their lives dearly ere they gave
up that mighty hope with side-whiskers and such promises!</p>

<p class='c009'>When those surveillants went away, quite convinced
that they were on the wrong track, the whole shanty’s
crew breathed a sigh of relief. It sounded as though
a young hurricane slept there, and had stirred in its sleep
<span class='pageno' id='Page_332'>332</span>as a score of “Phews!” of delighted relief went across
the hot, rum-smelling compartment, as one by one the
candles were relit. Swiftly taking the lid off the emergency
barrel, they dragged forth the old gentleman.
Their hearts were touched by the sight they beheld. His
eyes rolled, his clerical hat looked like a broken pancake
stuck on his head, it was smashed flat through the sudden
uncalculated fall of the heavy lid in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c009'>“What was that?” he wailed, as he recovered consciousness,
and the light of reason flickered across the
pupils of his sunken eyes.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Nothing much,” said someone soothingly, as they
pushed his smashed hat into shape. It was like attempting
to stand a corpse on its feet, ere <i>rigor mortis</i> had set
in, when they tried to stand him up.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Blimey! he’s a-going, blest if ’e ain’t,” said one.
Then they poured some rum down his throat.</p>

<p class='c009'>Rum seemed to have its virtues, for the old man made
a wonderful recovery after the dose was poured down
his throat. Half an hour afterwards he was singing
“Little Annie Rooney’s my sweetheart,” and telling
jokes. Then he sang again till his voice got wheezy,
telling tales as he banged his fist on the bench, and nudged
the men in the ribs, while they roared with laughter!
Still he drank on. “Rum! Rum!” shouted he. Then
he stood up on the bench and danced with a stout native
woman from Tambu-tambu village. The delight of the
women and the shanty members was such that they
nearly raised the roof with their wild encores and shouts.
He did a two-step dance! He mimicked the indescribable
barbarian contortions of that native woman’s monstrous
antics! He smacked her bare arms, pinched her tawny
flesh, winked like an old <i>roué</i>, showing conclusively what
manner of man he really was. The native children
peeped through the shanty doorway, and when they observed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_333'>333</span>that fashionable old gentleman dancing away with
a woman of their own land, they shrieked with delight.
The atmosphere of the Stone Age seemed to hang about
the old man as the derelicts around him cheered every
“turn” he gave, as he repeatedly recaught each “fine
careless rapture”!</p>

<p class='c009'>Then the hubbub subsided, and one by one the drunken
audience fell asleep. Old Tideman, who was a crank
on astronomy, crept outside with his telescope to look
at the stars. The wide-open door revealed the moonlit
palms just outside and the few straggling figures of sulu-clad
natives who had crept from afar to listen to the
songs of the wild white men! The last that was seen
of the old man that night was when he went off down
the track, his little clerical hat bashed over his eyes, his
arms waving as he tried to make his companion understand
how he admired her frizzly mop hair and lustrous
eyes. For it was the fat native woman with whom he
had danced a Fijian jig on the bench table! O’Hara
grinned when he met the old gent in the morning. He
responded by giving him a freezing stare, as though he
hardly knew him! He looked quite pious, as though he
only indulged in plain milk diet and studied ecclesiastical
problems. He looked bad though; one can’t bribe the
liver and make its overflow look blushing and rosy red
when it’s really a bilious green! The night of debauchery
had aged him considerably. His hands shook;
he didn’t know which way to go. First he picked a
flower, chewed it, then wiped his mouth and his clammy
forehead. O’Hara went straight into business then, and
said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I’m clearing out to-day. I’ve hired a fine outrigger-canoe
that’s big enough to hold twenty.” Then he looked
square into the aged fugitive’s face, and asked him if
he was coming along with us.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_334'>334</span>He was as pleased to get away from that place as we
were, that was very evident, for he decided to go away
with O’Hara and myself at once. There was no need
for secrecy, the shanty was quiet as the grave; for the
sleeping reprobates were making up by day for sleep
lost through the night. Only the forest banyans sighed
as we three crept away into the shadows, and then even
the wail of the derelict captain’s concertina faded away
as we plunged into the dense wood. When we arrived
at the native village we found, to our disgust, that the
man who had promised to lend us the canoe was out
fishing in it.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s no good getting ratty, guv’nor,” said O’Hara,
as the old fellow began to swear, and said he’d go back
to the Organization. We breathed a sigh of relief when
the native boat-owner at length returned. In a moment
we were off, bound for the shore. The old man dropped
his walking-stick in his hurry; we were all anxious to
get away. As we went down the long grove of feathery
palms and giant breadfruits the stars were shining over
the sea. We could feel the cool drifts of wind coming
in as they stirred the wild odours of half-dead forest
flowers and decaying pineapples. As we tramped down
the soft shore-track we saw the fireflies dancing in the
bamboos that grew high up on the edge of the rocky slope
above us, far ahead. It seemed as though we were looking
through a telescope and could see myriads of tiny
worlds sparkling and dancing far away in infinite space.</p>

<p class='c009'>When we arrived down by the big shore lagoon, there
lay the large outrigger, floating on the still water, just
as the native told us it would be. He trusted us. For
were we not “noble Papalagis”?</p>

<p class='c009'>Not a soul was in sight as we stepped into that strange
craft. In a minute or two we had pushed off into the
deeper water. We were both dab hands at paddling.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_335'>335</span>The scene looked like some picture of enchantment, some
picturesque landscape out of an Arabian Nights’ entertainment.
Only the dipping of the paddles which rippled
the glassy oil-painting-like stillness of the creek’s water
gave a certain reality to the mystic scene. The old man
might have been some weird old “Pasha of many tales”
starting off on a voyage into fairy-land with a clerical
hat on. It was only the swelling on the side of his head
where he had been thrust into the emergency barrel that
reminded one of gross, mundane things.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a terrifically hot night. The sea just outside
was perfectly calm and wonderfully bright. On the
horizon shone the large, low, yellow moon, bringing into
relief the wild inland shores, gullies, buttressed banyans,
and belts of mangroves that grew down to the ocean’s
edge.</p>

<p class='c009'>The moon looked like some far-off, phantom tunnel-way
as the ornamental prow of our canoe turned and
glided silently, making straight for its ghostly rim, due
south. The old fellow’s face was turned towards its
magnificent mystery; O’Hara sat in the centre of the
canoe, and I aft. We were not more than twenty yards
from the shore then. It really <i>did</i> look as though we
were paddling away from some enchanted isle; only the
cry of some strange night-bird and the leap of a tidal
wave over the reefs, as it splashed into the lagoon’s still
water, made a feeble, ghost-like noise.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s quite safe, fellows, I suppose?” queried the old
man, as he looked anxiously about him.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Safe as houses,” O’Hara replied. Then he said,
“What’s that?”</p>

<p class='c009'>We all looked shoreward. Out by the edge of the
promontory we distinctly saw a tiny phosphorescent
splash as though some strange animal had darted from
the forest and dived into the deep water.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_336'>336</span>We still watched, then we distinctly saw shivering lines
of silver ripples stealing towards us, coming fast, trembling
and spreading swiftly on the ocean’s perfectly calm,
moonlit surface.</p>

<p class='c009'>“It’s something big swimming under the water.
Begorra! a shark coming for us!” said O’Hara. The
old gent shot up on his feet with fright and nearly upset
the canoe! I think my comrade and I looked a bit
palish as the uncanniness of that movement of the unseen
came straight for us. “Wish I’d brought a revolver.
By St. Patrick! who’d ’ave thought things
was a-going to swim after us under the blasted
water?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“Keep still; don’t move!” said I, my heart in my
mouth, for the ripples were within thirty yards of our
canoe, and still no sign whatever of the cause of that
mysterious movement beneath the water.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then we stared as though we’d sighted a ghost; up
poked a tiny curly head, two bright, beautiful eyes were
staring reproachfully at me!</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good Lord!” I gasped; “it’s Soogy!”</p>

<p class='c009'>We pulled him into the canoe. O’Hara used an awful
swear word, said unprintable things. As for me, I felt
some strange, haunting kind of a fear come over me as
the child sat there.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You go tryer and getter away from your little
Soogy?” said that weird child.</p>

<p class='c009'>“No,” said I, shaking my head, feeling guilty as I
replied, “No, Soogy,” half apologetically! Then I said:
“We were coming back to-morrow morning. How on
earth did you know we were out here in a canoe?”</p>

<p class='c009'>The little fellow’s eyes brightened; he simply looked
at me earnestly for a while, then said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“I knower all ’bout you! The wind blow in cave by
sea and tell me all.”</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_337'>337</span>“Well, I’m blithered and damned if that kid won’t
bring us bad luck,” said O’Hara.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soogy had calmly got to the rear of the canoe, had
taken the steering-rod, and had started to guide us with
the splendid precision of a native child. The prow was
toward the south, bound for the isle of Lakemba.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I suppose you know your way?” suddenly said the
old gentleman, as he leaned forward, struck a match, and
lit a cigar.</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Hara never answered, simply looked contemptuously
at the white-whiskered face as the mouth sent up
curling whiffs of blue smoke into the clear moonlit air.
We were out in the deep ocean by then, paddling for all
we were worth. The distance by night took one quite
out of sight of land; even by daylight the nearest shore-line
in the farthest distance looked like a blue blotch
on the horizon.</p>

<p class='c009'>I think we had been paddling about an hour when the
moon suddenly went out and seemed to leave a puff of
bright smoke behind—it had gone behind a cloud.</p>

<p class='c009'>“That was sudden-like!” said O’Hara.</p>

<p class='c009'>It was a puff of wind; it blew the old gentleman’s hat
off.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Hope it’s not going to blow,” was my mental comment,
as once again a breath came down from the sky
and stirred the glassy surface. The old fellow saw the
look in our eyes, and, guessing that things were not as
well as they could be, said: “Why didn’t you tell me
we had to go out of sight of land? I’d never have
risked this; I wouldn’t—I wouldn’t,” he muttered to himself.
Then without further warning it came—crash! a
typhoon was on us. The first blast nearly blew the outrigger
out of the water. The only reason that it didn’t
turn turtle was that the outrigger contrivance had been
constructed by the superior savage intellect. It seemed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_338'>338</span>that the bright worlds of stars and sea had been sponged
off the map of existence, as we clung to each other, and
the mountainous seas heaved their backs and began to
roar like thunder around us. The old fellow had lost his
nerve, he wept and implored us to save him; but O’Hara
and I were very busy saving ourselves in that chaos of
dark and wind and ramping seas.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soogy was there all right, I felt his hand clinging to
my leg.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Keep still! For God’s sake, don’t move!” we both
cried, as the old man came to our end of the canoe,
nearly upsetting our planet, for such that craft was to
us. Soogy had taken a paddle to help O’Hara and so
keep her head on to the tremendous seas, but it was no
use; she slewed round and went broadside on, and so
the seas swamped us. But still we did not sink. Those
stout bamboo poles kept the craft buoyant and steady
as compared to what would have happened had they not
been there. For Soogy was sitting on the dancing outrigger,
balancing it as the big seas came on and tried in
vain to turn us upside down! Ah, he was a plucky little
beggar, quite devoid of fear. We three men simply
gave up the ghost so far as making intelligent efforts
to save ourselves were concerned. O’Hara clung to me,
I clung to O’Hara, and the old fellow clung to us both.
The hot, terrific wind hissed, shrieked over us as we
felt the canoe go up—up! on the mountainous seas, then
down—down! into the terrible thundering valleys as the
angry waters fell. Then once again we were climbing
the travelling hills that were drifting us away far out
into the vast solitude of the Pacific Ocean!</p>

<p class='c009'>It seemed as if that dark and roaring wind hung over
our heads for infinite ages. How we clung to that outrigger
and were not washed away is a mystery that is
connected with Providence and that word “inscrutable.”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_339'>339</span>When dawn at length brightened all the east, I lifted
my head half fearfully. Soogy was huddled beside me,
O’Hara on the other side, so tight that we were wedged
in. The old gentleman had managed to fix his head and
neck under the forward canoe-seat in such a way that
he had become a part of the canoe itself! His bald head,
through sea-water repeatedly washing over it, had become
quite bluish-looking. By some miracle his clerical-shaped
hat still lay just beside him. When O’Hara softly
pulled his coat to see if he was still alive, he half opened
his eyes and rolled them in a pathetic way. The fact
that he still lived relieved our loneliness. The wind had
ceased, but the swell remained, huge rolling hills of glassy
water rising and travelling at about four knots an hour.
We immediately commenced to bale out the canoe, using
a calabash and a tin which we discovered beneath the
seat. Soogy and the old man helped O’Hara and myself
in this task. We all felt deeply thankful when the sun
burst out over the great waste in all its tropical vigour.
Soogy began to sing, and cheered us up. None of us
seemed to realize the true state of affairs, that we were
out of sight of land, were castaways on the Pacific, our
paddles gone, and only about two pints of water in a rusty
tin can!</p>

<p class='c009'>The hot sunlight soon dried our soaked clothing.</p>

<p class='c009'>The old fugitive became transformed. The erstwhile
freezing look in his eyes had gone, and was replaced by
a gleam of friendly appeal to us! It was quite evident
that he saw things as they were, and had admitted O’Hara
and myself into his social circle, so to speak. He gave
us cigars. To our relief he discovered some matches
in his breast pocket; they were damp, but we placed them
on the rim of his clerical hat and they soon dried in the
hot sunlight. That hat had gone through something! To
this day I cannot look at a clerical hat without thinking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_340'>340</span>of typhoons and tropic skies shining over wastes of water
surrounded by illimitable skylines.</p>

<p class='c009'>We commenced carefully, and drank a very small drop
of water each. We made several attempts to make
paddles out of the spare calabash and the slit wood of
a canoe seat, but it was no good. We were drifting at
about four knots an hour to the north-east.</p>

<p class='c009'>As the hours went by we began to realize our position.
And yet, somehow, it seemed incredible that we should
be cast away on those lonely waters so easily.</p>

<p class='c009'>“A ship is sure to pass us soon,” said O’Hara.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Of course it is,” I replied, as our aged companion put
his hand to his brow and repeatedly scanned the horizon.
I even laughed, and so did O’Hara, and I thought of my
old sea-adventure books, and felt quite a romantic hero
of the tropic seas. But I soon began to feel very unheroic,
and felt inclined to laugh on “the other side of my
mouth,” as they say. It was the coming of night that
made the romantic novelty wear off. There’s nothing in
the world like the shadows of night coming over the
heads of castaways to make them sadly <i>realize</i>, so I
should think. Reality came down on us like a huge,
Fate-like hand, and seemed to crush, smash us as though
we were bedraggled flies on a mighty window-pane!</p>

<p class='c009'>Night was a nightmare with a myriad starry eyes.
Thirst had us in its grip, but we dare not drink the tiny
drop of water that remained in the can. I fell asleep for
five minutes, but only managed to fall off into some gulf
of misery that was mixed up with the horror of death
and castaway canoes. Then O’Hara and I sat up and
started to sing a sea-chanty, to cheer up the old gentleman
and little Soogy. But, withal, Soogy was plucky enough.
As for the aged fugitive, he started to carry on in a
terrible way, and kept crying out: “Lost at sea in a
boat! Lost at sea in a boat!” Then he got sleepy and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_341'>341</span>mumbled it out in a pathetic, far-away tone, and got on
our nerves more than I can express in cold words.</p>

<p class='c009'>I once fancied that I saw the light of a passing vessel,
but it soon died away, whatever it was.</p>

<p class='c009'>“May the Holy Virgin protect us all!” said O’Hara.</p>

<p class='c009'>Then dawn came. Soogy stopped singing songs. The
sight of the child’s bright, fevered eyes and parched lips
unnerved us. O’Hara did the worst thing he could do,
gave the child a tiny drop of spirit as he lay moaning
out on the twisted bamboo grating of the outrigger.
Soogy tried hard to buck up, but his small frame hadn’t
the lasting power that our larger frames possessed. At
the end of the second day, as near as I can remember,
we realized our position, and knew that we were floating
on the very edge of eternity. The old man became
quite brave. His eyes lost all the old cunning and craft
that I had so particularly observed in them. Even then,
my numbed senses seemed to realize that it was only
the worldly world that makes men bad, the earthly values
of things inspiring them with greed till their darker
passions overgrow their better qualities as weeds overgrow
and strangle flowers.</p>

<p class='c009'>We shared out the last drop of water. The old gentleman
gave Soogy a part of his share, and we did likewise.
O’Hara became quite religious, in the true sense of that
much misused word. Through the whole day and night
we never ceased lifting our weary heads to stare on the
skyline. But no vessel passed. The old man placed his
large red handkerchief over Soogy. It was a terrible
sight, as Soogy’s hands tossed, to see the blisters on the
little arms. But it was no use waving to the hot tropic
sun as it shone up there in the cloudless sky.</p>

<p class='c009'>“We’re done for,” said O’Hara; then he, too, lay
down again, and seemed to grow careless as to whatever
might happen.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_342'>342</span>That night Soogy revived in a wonderful way. I was
lying in a semi-conscious state when I felt someone gently
touch my arm.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You sorry for Soogy?” said a far-away-sounding
voice. The child was staring in my eyes in a strange,
quiet way.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Perhaps I’m dreaming,” I thought, as a great sense
of the unreal came over me. My heart began to thump
and my senses to whirl and swim. O’Hara and the old
man were lying just beside us, perfectly quiet, as though
dead. I stared into the eyes of the wistful little face.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Is it you, Soogy?” I said in a hushed voice, as I
lifted my aching head. “Dear God!” I muttered, as
I realized something for the first time, while the child’s
eyes stared into my own. I felt that I had never seen
such soft, beautiful eyes before. Floating there, under
the stars of the tropic seas, nothing seemed too strange
or wonderful to occur. A terrible sorrow possessed me
as I touched the soft, tiny hand, and pressed my lips
to those pleading lips! For a little while, that seemed
like a thousand years, Soogy huddled beneath the folds
of my coat.</p>

<p class='c009'>“You come to me if I die, come to heathenland?”
Such was what a faint voice, like far-off music, whispered
in my ears. I cannot say one word of all that I whispered
into the child’s ear. I said mad things, I know.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I happy now, Papalagi,” whispered that faint, strange
voice.</p>

<p class='c009'>At daybreak Soogy died.</p>

<p class='c009'>O’Hara laid the silent form out on the edge of the
outrigger’s grating. All that day O’Hara and I kept
our backs turned towards that silent form, lying there,
face downwards. I told O’Hara to lay Soogy like that.
I couldn’t stand seeing those earnest eyes staring all night
up at the merciless infinity of stars.</p>

<p class='c009'><span class='pageno' id='Page_343'>343</span>The old fugitive became insane. We only saw his
head move; he had covered it over with a bit of sacking
to keep the sun’s rays off.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Forgive me, Cissie—forgive me, Cissie; keep the
keys—keep the keys,” he kept saying over and over again
in his delirium. The sky was no longer a sky to me, it
was a monstrous slab lying over a mighty vault wherein
the dead still breathed as they floated and tossed their
arms in agony on illimitable waters.</p>

<p class='c009'>Soogy’s death seemed to revive O’Hara and me; yet
we said very little to each other. It was a world of
dreams that we stared in, some phantasmagorial existence
where only death whispered as the outrigger plopped
in the star-mirroring deep around us. O’Hara was no
longer my pal in sorrow; we had become rivals in some
terrible struggle of will-power. The energy of the whole
universe seemed to be wholly concentrated on one vital
move on the tremendous chess-board of that phantasmal
world of water whereon we drifted. O’Hara and I were
the sorrowing slaves of Fate; nothing else existed, only
he and I and the dreadful thought as to which one of us
must put forth our hand and make that terrible move.
It was inevitable that one of us must do it, for on those
tropic seas there was no other way than to crawl out
on the outrigger and push that small dead form into the
vast depths that moved around us. The tropic moon
loomed on the horizon. It might have been the uprising
sun, for all I knew, in that world of horror that I had
been plunged into. I looked over the canoe’s side and
gazed into the glassy depths. I saw a great shark gliding
along under the surface. It seemed natural that it should
be there, waiting for us. I gazed in a languid, interested
way as that cannibal of the deep turned softly over on
its back and revealed its shining belly. Its cruel, monstrous
mouth looked like some materialized jaw of pallid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_344'>344</span>hate as it softly snapped at my shadow that lay in the
moonlit deep, and severed it in two! Then O’Hara dissolved
into some cobweb-like substance and was blown
away on the puff of wind that crept across the hot seas.</p>

<p class='c009'>Dawn came like a mighty torrent of silver and swept
across the silent world of waters. I felt that I was
floating across shadow-seas. For a little while I heard
a faint moaning and felt cool sea-water slashing over
me. I tried to move, but something held my feet down
in a merciless grip. It was all the more terrible because
I realized in some mysterious way that I was far at sea
on that castaway canoe. The fact was, that a breeze
had sprung up and the canoe was being tossed wildly to
and fro. Why none of us was thrown out is a mystery.
Anyhow, the blow was of short duration, for I suddenly
lifted my head, and saw O’Hara and the old gentleman
lying perfectly still beside me. Then the world seemed
to change again: night fell over the sea. Again I watched
that silent form lying out on the grating. Again the
dawn sent grey wings along the eastern horizon. It
was then that I became strangely calm, and, terrible as
the sight was, as that child lay dead on the grating of
the canoe, I smiled and looked upon it all as the most
commonplace of experiences.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Good-bye, Soogy,” I said, then I gently pushed the
small figure from the bamboo-outrigger. Some terrible
spell of curiosity gripped me. I stared down into the
water in wistful fascination, as, leaning over, I watched
the spot where the ripples spread, where the small form
had gone down, down into the clear, still ocean depth
at dawn. I could still distinctly see Soogy sinking down
into the grave! It looked like the figure of some tiny
child imaged in some vast crystal mirror as down, down
it went. Only the mournful cry of a solitary sea-bird,
as it passed across the sky and sent a shadow over that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_345'>345</span>wandering grave, broke the stillness. Then I saw the
figure begin to sway rhythmically to some deep ocean
current. Presently it looked no bigger than a penny
terra-cotta-coloured doll.</p>

<p class='c009'>Ah, I had hoped to find that it was all a dream as I
still watched, rubbed my eyes, and hoped with a terrible
hope. I well knew, as that tiny remnant of mortality
faded from sight, that I was living in some terrible
sorrow of reality. I thought of those forest dances away
in Fiji, of the weird, tender glances of those deep, golden-iris
eyes, when Soogy crept out of the forest palms to
make my bed. I remembered the sweet, weird song the
heathen child had sung to me, and how the witch-like
little singer had stared across the camp-fire till I had
felt some strange fright! But the mystery of it all had
vanished, for, on the second night after the storm, O’Hara
and I had discovered the truth—Soogy was no boy at
all, but a half-caste Polynesian girl!</p>

<p class='c009'>A great silence seemed to come over the world after
Soogy sank from sight. And then my dreams were
broken, and I fancied I could hear the breakers beating
against eternity. Someone touched me softly on the
brow, and a voice said:</p>

<p class='c009'>“Try and stand on your feet; we’re saved, pal.”</p>

<p class='c009'>I half realized something, and sat up. I looked immediately
to the southward and saw the eternal wastes of
sea-skyline, then I glanced round and noticed that our
canoe was tossing about on a heavy swell just off a
rocky coast. We were so near the reefs that I could
head the soughing of the wind along the bending tracts
of shore palms (it turned out to be the Tonga Islands).
O’Hara was sitting on the bamboo grating of the canoe’s
outrigger. His face appeared extremely thin and was
ghastly pale. The aged fugitive sat huddled by the prow,
his battered clerical hat held in his trembling hand, his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_346'>346</span>chin on his chest, a wild look in his eyes. They both
looked like emaciated phantom-figures, quite unreal.
Only at that moment in my life did I realize in a flash
how we mortals are but shadows moving through some
dream that divides our existence from the boundless
reality of the great shadowland. True enough, too, I
had awakened from a terrible reality into a darker dream.</p>

<p class='c009'>“The child’s gone!” said O’Hara.</p>

<p class='c009'>“I know,” I muttered in a vacant way before I realized
the truth. Then, in the terror of dawning realization,
I gasped out, “Where’s Soogy?”</p>

<p class='c009'>“She must have been washed away by the squall last
night,” said O’Hara, and his voice was as gentle as a
girl’s.</p>

<hr class='c024' />

<p class='c009'>After that tragical experience we were taken in by
the missionaries at Tonga and treated with the kindness
that is always shown to shipwrecked men wherever they
may go. We soon recovered physically from the buffeting
of our castaway voyage. I know that in the comfort
of life under secure conditions in Tonga, the old gentleman’s
freezing look almost came back to his little blue
eyes; but when he discovered that I was a professional
violinist as well as a vagabond troubadour, his manner
became almost polite. This deeply-rooted conventional
attribute of the old man’s was the more noticeable when
I secured a position at Nukualofa as Court violinist to
King George of Tonga,<a id='r8' /><a href='#f8' class='c019'><sup>[8]</sup></a> also a munificent salary that
was considerably augmented by gifts from the head missionaries,
who willingly paid me for my solos at the
mission-room concerts. My Irish comrade could hardly
believe his eyes when I stood on the primitive platforms
of the native villages and became an enthusiastic appealer
to the souls of the pagan Tongans. I recall that, when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_347'>347</span>I played and conducted the royal string band in the native
wedding-march on the marriage of some prince of the
old dynasty, the Queen of Tonga presented me with an
exquisitely carved tortoise-shell comb from her hair. Indeed,
I was doing exceedingly well, considering that I
had no letters of introduction. This kind of thing went
on for nearly three weeks, when a full-rigged sailing-ship,
the “Orontes,” dropped anchor off the island. Its sails
gleaming in the sunset, shining like beautiful signals of
romance, called me, till the old roaming spirit, asserting
itself, shattered all my ambitions over kings, queens,
missionaries, Court appointments, and salaries. The
“Orontes” was bound for Ysabel, Solomon Isles, and
British New Guinea. When I went aboard her and interviewed
the skipper, telling him I wanted a berth, he
shook his head, and said he could get a dozen Kanakas
for the price of a drink, as good as any white men, any
day. And so, when the “Orontes,” with her sails bellying
to the winds, bowed to the sunset on her long voyage
across the Pacific, O’Hara and I lay huddled on old
sacks in the deep gloom of the <i>forepeak-hold</i>, where we
had secured the cheapest berth—as stowaways!</p>

<div class='footnote c020' id='f8'>
<p class='c021'><span class='label'><a href='#r8'>8</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>King George of Tonga died recently, 1918.</p>
</div>

<p class='c009'>In my imagination I can still see O’Hara’s grimy,
unshaven face as he sits in the gloom beside me, puffs
his short pipe, and drinks at regular intervals from the
water-bottle. The rats squeak.</p>

<p class='c009'>“Don’t smoke, for Heaven’s sake,” I say, as O’Hara
strikes another match on the ship’s iron side. I feel
sick enough in that stuffy hold as the vessel pitches to
the swell. Then, as I sit there amongst the strong, evil-smelling
merchandise of our wandering argosy, I place
my fiddle on my knee and go “pink-e-te ponk-e-te,” pizzicato
style, as my fingers strum out an old English melody.</p>

<p class='c009'>“For God’s sake, shut up, pal!” says O’Hara, as we
hear the sailormen tramping on the deck just overhead,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_348'>348</span>as they go on watch in the silence of the hot tropic night.</p>

<p class='c009'>But all that’s past now. My Irish comrade went out
of my life years ago. And I suppose the old fugitive,
with his clerical hat, has long since paid his last debt,
and kind men have hidden his artful face in that place
where no living man will search to find him. As for the
Charity Organization, it has most probably discarded long
ago its primitive style and locality, and now maybe does
its good work from some more palatial institution in
the remoter islands of the Pacific. With the advancement
of civilization things are carried on in more sumptuous
style. Indeed, I would not be surprised to hear
that the new Charity Organization Hermitage, that welcomes
the homeless derelicts who have flown in haste
from the western cities, has a gilded dome and spire
peeping from a solitary forest of some remote isle of
the southern seas. Possibly a secret cable runs under
the Pacific, running straight from its guarding seclusion,
sending out warnings to its prospective protégés. Indeed,
even in those far-off days, Bones’ establishment
at Fiji had depots that extended to the extreme points
of the civilized world. And it was marvellous how
often the keen surveillants of the Australian seaboard
cities were baffled in their search for missing bank-managers,
etc. So wags the world, things only apparently
changing as one age appears to differ from another age.
It is only the hearts of men that remain the same, as
the centuries pass and fashions change, so that men may
open their doors inwards instead of outwards, and so
sit and dream that the moral codes of the world have
become reversed. Even my rose-coloured spectacles remain
the same; though they have become somewhat
dimmed, I can still fix them on and gaze with hopeful
eyes on the wondrous pageant of life that moves with me
along the great vagabond track. And many times have
<span class='pageno' id='Page_349'>349</span>I sought to lend them to sad men and women who staggered
beside me, yes, as they stared blindly through their
bits of smoky glass. But sometimes I shiver with dread
at the possibility that I may some day grow wise and
restrained, and no longer love fairy-tales, fallen, sinful
men, and beautiful women of four years old. And so
I often rekindle my camp-fire and sit alone, so that I
may hear the forest trees singing overhead. It is then
that O’Hara comes back out of the shadows; and, as
I play my violin, sings some rollicking Irish song. And,
strange as it may appear to some, when the log fire is
burning low, a misty pageant passes before my eyes.
One by one my old tribal poets, attired in all the primitive
majesty of tattoo and tapu-robes, stalk by me, and pass
silently down the moonlit banyan groves. ’Tis then that
the call comes again; for I am the doomed rolling stone
that gathered the magical moss of these memoirs and
all that has made me know how little men are, and
humbly realize that I have chanced to live universally
instead of only roaming in my boots over the wide spaces
of this beautiful world. In this wise I have found and
placed carefully down any little campfire-gleams of interest
which my book may possess, as well as having
found my religion in some sorrow of the eternity of all
things past. I still jog along, carrying my staff and
my violin, and weighted swag of dreams, as I roam along
the forest track. And, though I have many years to
travel ere I become old, I can say in the deeper sense
of its meaning:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c025'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>There’s not a flower along the wild hillside,</div>
      <div class='line'>Or song-bird of the woods that sang and died,</div>
      <div class='line'>But it has kinship with the winds that blow</div>
      <div class='line'>O’er memory’s forest trees of long ago.</div>
      <div class='line'>And not a beggar in the distant lands</div>
      <div class='line'>But I am with him, heart and soul and hands—</div>
      <div class='line'>To help him carry his old swag of dreams</div>
      <div class='line'><span class='pageno' id='Page_350'>350</span>In some great twinship of our shattered schemes;</div>
      <div class='line'>As deep within my heart I hear the chime</div>
      <div class='line'>Of night winds tolling all the bells of Time—</div>
      <div class='line'>In some old belfry of the stars they ring</div>
      <div class='line'>The songs the dead men dream and cannot sing.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c023'>Even the bluest, grandest ocean of the world exists
in my mind only as some deep, solemn hymning that
tells the briefness of mortal existence. Sometimes, when
I hear the wind blow in the night, my thoughts go flying
out to the wide Pacific that heaves under the stars, and
is, to me, the vast, wandering grave wherein ill-fated
Soogy, the native child, sleeps.</p>
